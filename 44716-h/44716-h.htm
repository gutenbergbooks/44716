<p class="title">BASEBALL JOE<br />
CAPTAIN OF THE TEAM</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>QUEER TACTICS</small></h2>


<p>“No use talking, Joe, we seem to be on the toboggan,”
remarked Jim Barclay, one of the first
string pitchers of the Giant team, to his closest
chum, Joe Matson; as they came out of the clubhouse
at the Chicago baseball park and strolled
over toward their dugout in the shadow of the
grandstand.</p>

<p>“You’re right, old boy,” agreed Joe&mdash;“Baseball
Joe,” as he was known by the fans all over
the country. “We seem to be headed straight
for the cellar championship, and at the present
rate it won’t be long before we land there. I
can’t tell what’s got into the boys. Perhaps I’m
as much to blame as any of the rest of them. I’ve
lost the last two games I pitched.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” snorted Jim. “Look at the way you
lost them! You never pitched better in your life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
You had everything&mdash;speed, curves, control, and
that old fadeaway of yours was working like a
charm. But the boys played behind you like a
lot of sand-lotters. They simply threw the game
away&mdash;handed it to the Cubs on a silver platter.
What they did in the field was a sin and a shame.
And when it came to batting, they were even
worse. The home run and triple you pasted out
yourself were the only clouts worth mentioning.”</p>

<p>“The boys do seem to have lost their batting
eyes,” agreed Joe. “And when it comes to fielding,
they’re all thumbs. What do you think the
trouble is?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” replied Jim. “We’ve got the
same team we had when we started the season.
Look at the way we started off: Three out of
four from the Brooklyns, the same from the Bostons,
and a clean sweep from the Phillies. It
looked as though we were going to go through the
League like a prairie fire. But the instant we
struck the West we went down with a sickening
thud. Pittsburgh wiped up the earth with us.
The Reds walked all over us. The Cubs in the
last two games have given us the razz. We’re
beginning to look like something the cat dragged
in.”</p>

<p>“I can’t make it out,” observed Joe, thoughtfully.
“Of course, every team gets in a slump
sometimes. But this has lasted longer than usual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and it’s time we snapped out of it. McRae will
be a raving lunatic if we don’t.”</p>

<p>“He’s pretty near that now,” replied Jim.
“And I don’t wonder. He’d set his heart on
winning the flag this season, and it begins to look
as though his cake was dough.”</p>

<p>“Even Robbie’s lost his smile,” said Joe.
“And things must be pretty bad when he gets into
the doleful dumps.”</p>

<p>“I thought that when we got those rascals,
Hupft and McCarney, off the team, everything
would be plain sailing,” remarked Jim. “They
seemed to be the only disorganizing element.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Joe. “And especially when we
got such crackerjacks in their places as Jackwell
and Bowen. But speaking of them, have you noticed
anything peculiar about them?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Jim, in some alarm.
“You don’t mean to intimate that they’re crooks,
too?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Joe. “From all I can
see, they are as white as any men on the team.
And they certainly know baseball from A to Z.
They can run rings around Hupft and McCarney.
But, just the same, I’ve noticed something odd
about them from the start.”</p>

<p>“What, for instance?” asked Jim, with quickened
interest.</p>

<p>“They seem nervous and scared at times,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Joe. “Jackwell, at third, keeps looking
towards that part of the grandstand. The other
day I was going to throw to him, to catch Elston
napping; but I saw that Jackwell wasn’t looking
at me, and so I held the ball. And I’ve noticed
that when he’s coming into the bench between
innings he lets his eyes range all over the stands.”</p>

<p>“Looking to see if his girl was there, perhaps,”
laughed Jim.</p>

<p>“Nothing so pleasant as that,” asserted Joe.
“It was as though he were looking for some one
he didn’t want to see. And the same thing is
true of Bowen. Of course he’s out at center, and
I can’t observe him as well as I can Jackwell.
But when he’s been sitting in the dugout waiting
for his turn at bat, he’s always squinting at the
fans in the stands and the bleachers. The other
boys aren’t that way.”</p>

<p>“This is all news to me,” remarked Jim. “I’ve
noticed that they’ve been rather clannish and
stuck close together, but that’s natural enough,
seeing that they were pals in the minor-league
team from which McRae bought them and that
they don’t feel quite at home yet in big-league
company.”</p>

<p>“Well, you keep your eye on them and see if
you don’t notice what I’ve been telling you about,”
counseled Joe. “Of course, it may not mean a
thing, but all the same it’s struck me as queer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the two pitchers had reached the
Giants’ dugout, where most of their teammates
had already gathered.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day in early summer. The
Eastern teams’ invasion of the West was in full
swing, and baseball enthusiasm was running high
all over the circuit. The Giants, after a disastrous
series of games in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati,
had struck Chicago. Or, perhaps, it would
be more correct to say that Chicago had struck
them, for the Cubs had taken the first two games
with ease.</p>

<p>No doubt that accounted for the tremendous
throng that had been pouring into the gates that
afternoon, until now the stands and bleachers
were crowded with enthusiastic fans. For if there
was anything in the world that Chicago dearly
loved, it was to see the Giants beaten. One game
from the haughty Giants, the champions of the
world, was more keenly relished than two games
from any other club.</p>

<p>The rivalry between the teams of the two great
cities was intense, dating from the days when the
old Chicagos, with “Pop” Anson and Frank
Chance at their head, had been accustomed to
sweeping everything before them. Now the tables
had been turned, and for the last few years, the
Giants, with McRae as their astute manager and
Baseball Joe as their pitching “ace,” had had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
upper hand. Twice in succession the Giants had
won the championship of the National League
and had wound up the season in a blaze of glory
by also winning the World Series.</p>

<p>This year they were desperately anxious to repeat.
And, as Jim had said, it looked at the beginning
of the season as though they were going
to do it. They got off on the right foot and had
an easy time of it in the games with the other
Eastern clubs.</p>

<p>But with the Western clubs it was another story.
A “jinx” seemed to be pursuing them. Pittsburgh
had tied the can to them, and the Reds, not to be
outdone, had tightened the knot. The Cubs thus
far had clawed them savagely. They had tasted
blood, and their appetite had grown with what
it had fed upon. And for that reason the sport
lovers of the Windy City had turned out in force
to see the Cubs once more make the Giants “their
meat.”</p>

<p>McRae, the manager, was sitting on the bench
with Robson, his assistant, as Joe and Jim approached.
There was an anxious furrow on his
brow, and even the rotund and rubicund “Robbie,”
usually jolly and smiling, seemed in the depths of
gloom.</p>

<p>McRae’s face lightened a little when he saw
Joe.</p>

<p>“I’m going to put you in to pitch to-day, Matson,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
he said. “How’s the old soup-bone feeling?”</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy,” returned Joe, with a smile.</p>

<p>“I want you to stand those fellows on their
heads,” said the manager. “They’ve been making
monkeys of us long enough.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, Mac,” promised Joe, as he
picked up a ball preparatory to going out for
warming-up practice.</p>

<p>“Your best is good enough,” replied McRae.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim went out with their respective
catchers and limbered up their pitching arms.</p>

<p>“How are they coming, Mylert?” Joe called
out to the veteran catcher, who was acting as his
backstop.</p>

<p>“Great,” pronounced Mylert. “You’ve got
speed to burn and your curves are all to the merry.
That hop of yours is working fine. You’ll have
them breaking their backs to get at the ball.”</p>

<p>McRae, in the meantime, had beckoned to Iredell,
the captain of the team.</p>

<p>“Look here, Iredell,” he asked abruptly,
“what’s the matter with this team? Why are
they playing like a lot of old women?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” replied Iredell, flushing
and twirling his cap nervously.</p>

<p>“Don’t know?” snapped McRae. “Who
should know if you don’t? You’re the captain,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure,” admitted Iredell. “But for all that,
I can’t always get onto what’s in the minds of the
fellows. I’ve talked to them and razzed them
and done everything except to lam them. They’re
just in a slump, and they don’t seem able to get
out. Some of them think a jinx is on their backs.
I’m playing my own position well enough, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are,” McRae was forced to admit,
for Iredell was one of the crack shortstops of the
League, and so far had been batting and fielding
well. “But that isn’t enough. To be a good
shortstop is one thing, and to be a good captain
is another. I figured you’d be both. Tell me
this. Are there any cliques in the team? Any
fellows out to do another or show him up?
Any fights in the clubhouse that I haven’t been
told about?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Iredell, “nothing that’s worth
noticing. Of course, the boys are as sore as boils
over the way they keep on losing, and their tempers
are on a hair trigger. Once in a while something
is said that makes one of them take a crack
at another. But that’s usually over in a minute
and they shake hands and make up. There aren’t
any real grudges among the boys that I know of.”</p>

<p>“Well, things have got to change, and it’s
largely up to you to change them,” growled
McRae. “If the job’s too big for you, perhaps
somebody else will have to take it. I’ve often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
found that a shake up in the batting order will
work wonders. Perhaps the same thing’s true of
a shake up in captains.”</p>

<p>The flush in Iredell’s face grew deeper and his
eyes glinted with anger. But he said nothing, and
as McRae turned to say something to Robbie, indicating
that the interview was ended, he moved
away sullenly from the dugout.</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang as a signal for the Giants
to run out for practice. The white uniforms of
the Chicagos faded away from the diamond, while
the gray-suited Giants scattered to their several
positions in the field and on the bases.</p>

<p>Jackwell, who had been standing near Joe while
the latter was putting the balls over to Mylert,
started to run out with the rest, but suddenly he
halted and stood in his tracks like a stone image.</p>

<p>Joe, who, out of the corner of his eye, had
noted the action, turned to him in surprise.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jackwell?” he asked,
eying the new third baseman keenly.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I can’t go on,” stammered Jackwell.</p>

<p>Joe noted that he had suddenly turned white.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A BITTER STRUGGLE</small></h2>


<p>Jackwell’s legs were sagging, and Joe,
alarmed at his condition and afraid that he was
going to fall, put his arm about the baseman’s
shoulder to support him.</p>

<p>“Brace up, old man,” he counseled. “What’s
come over you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I don’t know,” answered Jackwell, trying
desperately to get a grip on himself. “I suddenly
felt faint. Everything got black before my
eyes.”</p>

<p>“Touch of the sun, maybe,” said Joe, kindly.
“Come over and get a drink of water and then sit
down on the bench for a few minutes. I’ll ask
one of the other fellows to take your place at third
for practice.”</p>

<p>Jackwell sank down on the bench, while Joe
returned to his practice with Mylert, somewhat
upset by the incident.</p>

<p>A moment later, Bowen, the new centerfielder,
came along, and Jackwell beckoned to him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sat down beside him, and the two conversed in
whispers, casting surreptitious glances at a part
of the grandstand almost directly behind the
third-base position.</p>

<p>Joe kept his eye on the two men and saw Bowen
start violently at something Jackwell whispered
to him. His face seemed suddenly to have been
drained of every drop of blood, and he shook like
a man with the ague.</p>

<p>Just then McRae, who had been having an exchange
of repartee with Evans, the manager of the
Chicago team, who had chaffed him unmercifully
about the playing of the Giants, came back to
the dugout. He glanced in surprise at the two
players.</p>

<p>“What are you fellows doing here?” he asked
sharply, glowering at them. “Didn’t you hear
the bell ring for practice? Why aren’t you in
your places on the field?”</p>

<p>“I’m sick, Mr. McRae,” replied Jackwell. “I
wish you’d put somebody else in my place. I
ain’t in condition to play to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’m in the same fix,” put in Bowen. “I feel
like thirty cents.”</p>

<p>“That’s what the whole team’s worth,”
growled McRae. “And even at that price the
fellow that bought them would get stung. What
do you mean, sick? Are you sick or just lazy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
soldiering on the job? You seemed husky enough
this morning.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it may have been something we ate at
noon,” suggested Jackwell, rather lamely. “A
touch of ptomaine poisoning, or something like
that.”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll play if you tell me to,” put in
Bowen. “But I don’t feel up to my work.”</p>

<p>McRae stood for a moment in exasperated
study of the two. For some reason their excuses
did not ring true. Yet their pale faces and evidently
unstrung condition seemed to bear out their
words.</p>

<p>“Guess there is a jinx after this team all right,”
he growled. “You fellows go over to the club
doctor and let him find out what’s the matter
with you. I’ll put other men in your places for
the present.”</p>

<p>They hurriedly availed themselves of the permission,
and McRae, after a consultation with
Robbie, put Renton in Jackwell’s place and sent
McGuire out in center to hold down Bowen’s
position.</p>

<p>Again the bell rang, and the Cubs took their
final practice. That they were in fine condition
for the fray was evident from the way they shot
the ball across the diamond. Dazzling plays and
almost impossible catches brought round after
round of applause from the spectators. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
plain that the whole team was in fine fettle, and
that the Giants had their work cut out for them
if they were to win.</p>

<p>The Giants, as the visiting team, were first at
bat. Axander, the star twirler of the Cubs,
picked up the ball and went into the box with a
jaunty air that bespoke plenty of confidence.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>Axander dug his toes into the box and wound
up for the first pitch.</p>

<p>And while the crowd watched breathlessly to
see the ball leave his hand, it may be well for the
benefit of those who have not read the preceding
volumes of this series to tell who Baseball Joe was
and trace his career up to the time this story
opens.</p>

<p>Joe Matson had been born and brought up in
the little town of Riverside in a middle western
state. From early boyhood he had been a great
lover of the national game, especially of the pitching
end of it, to which he had taken naturally.
His coolness, quick thinking, good judgment and
powerful arm specially fitted him for the box.
He soon became known for his skill as a twirler
on his home team, and his reputation spread to
surrounding towns. His early exploits and the
difficulties he had to encounter and overcome are
told in the first volume of this series, entitled:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
“Baseball Joe of the Silver Stars; or, The Rivals
of Riverside.”</p>

<p>Later, on his school nine, he overcame the obstacles
thrown in his way by the bully of the
school and pitched his team to victory over his
rivals. His field was widened when he went to
Yale, and in an emergency he assumed the pitcher’s
burden and downed Princeton in a glorious
battle.</p>

<p>That victory proved a turning point in Joe’s
life, for the game had been witnessed by a scout
for a minor-league team, always on the alert for
talent, and he made Joe an offer to join the Pittston
team of the Central League. Joe accepted
the offer, and soon climbed to the position of the
leading twirler in the League.</p>

<p>Still, he was only a “busher,” and his delight
can be imagined when, at the end of the season,
he was drafted into the St. Louis team of the
National League. Now he was really in fast
company, and had to test his skill against the
greatest twirlers in the country. But the fans
were quick to learn that he could hold his own
with the best of them.</p>

<p>McRae, the manager of the Giants, one of the
ablest men in baseball when it came to judging the
ability of a player, determined to get Joe for the
Giants. He did get him, and had never ceased
congratulating himself on the stroke that brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Joe to his team. He soon became its mainstay,
and had been the main factor in winning the championship
of the National League and the World
Series twice in succession. He was a wizard in
the box, and his record as pitcher had never been
equaled in the history of the game.</p>

<p>And not only in the box, but at the bat he had
proved himself without a peer. He was a natural
batsman, timing and meeting the ball perfectly
and leaning all the weight of his mighty shoulders
against it so that it soared far beyond the reach
of the fielders. When he hit the ball it was very
often ticketed for a homer, and at every city on
the League circuit thousands were attracted to
the games not only to see a marvelous exhibition
of pitching but to see Matson “knock out another
home run.” What celebrity he gained by his work
in both departments is told in a previous volume,
and the way in which he saved the game from scandal
when it was threatened by a gang of crooked
gamblers is narrated in the last volume of the
series entitled: “Baseball Joe Saving the League;
or, Breaking Up a Great Conspiracy.”</p>

<p>But Joe had won other triumphs than those of
baseball. He had fallen in love with Mabel Varley,
a charming girl whose life he had saved in a
runaway accident, and he had married her at the
end of the previous season on the diamond. They
were ideally happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim Barclay, a Princeton man who had joined
the Giants, had speedily developed into a pitcher
only second to Joe himself. He and Joe had
become the closest of chums, and on a visit to
Riverside Jim had fallen a victim to the charms
of Joe’s pretty sister, Clara, and was now engaged
to her and hoped for an early marriage.</p>

<p>And now to return to the tense situation on the
Chicago ball field, where the Cubs and Giants
faced each other in one of the critical games of
the series.</p>

<p>Curry, the rightfielder of the Giants, was first
at bat. He was a good hitter and was as fast as
a flash in getting to first.</p>

<p>Axander shot over a high fast one at which
Curry refused to bite, and it went as a ball. Then
came a pretty first strike right over the heart of
the plate. Axander came back with a slow one
that lobbed up to the plate looking as big as a
balloon. Curry nearly dislocated his spine reaching
for it, and though he connected with it he
raised an easy fly, which the Cubs’ third baseman
caught without moving from his tracks.</p>

<p>Iredell came next to the plate, swinging three
bats. He threw away two of them, tapped each
of his heels with the other for luck, faced the
pitcher and glared at him ferociously.</p>

<p>“Put one over, you false alarm, and see me
murder it,” he called to Axander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Axander grinned at him.</p>

<p>“You’re the captain of the team, aren’t you?”
he asked. “Well, you’ll be only a lieutenant when
I get through with you.”</p>

<p>He whizzed one over that Iredell swung at
savagely and missed. The next he fouled off,
making the second strike. Then came a ball and
then a third strike, so swift that Iredell struck
at it as it settled in the catcher’s glove.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” shouted the umpire.</p>

<p>Iredell threw down his bat in chagrin and retired
to the bench.</p>

<p>Then Burkett, the burly first baseman of the
Giants, strode to the plate. He caught the first
ball pitched right near the end of his stick and
belted it into the rightfield stands. It looked like
a sure homer, and the contingent of loyal Giant
rooters burst into a cheer. But the cheer was
premature, as the umpire called it a foul, and
Burkett, who had already rounded first, returned,
disgruntled, to the plate.</p>

<p>“Had your eyes tried for glasses lately?” he
asked the umpire.</p>

<p>“That’ll be about all from you,” returned that
functionary. “Another wise crack like that, and
it’s you for the showers.”</p>

<p>Axander’s next throw went for a ball. On the
next Burkett whaled a sharp single over second.
A moment later, however, he was caught napping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at first by a quick throw from the pitcher, and the
inning ended without a score. Burkett, who found
himself in his regular position at first, put on his
glove and stayed there, glad enough that he was
not near enough to the Giants’ dugout to get the
tongue lashing that McRae had all ready for him.</p>

<p>“Did you see that boob play, Robbie?” McRae
growled. “Did you see the way that perfectly
good hit was wasted?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I saw it, John,” replied Robson, laying
his hand soothingly on the knee of his irate friend.
“’Twas enough to make a man tear his hair out
by the roots. But the game’s young yet and we
may have the last laugh. I’m banking heavily on
what Joe’s going to do to them birds.”</p>

<p>Joe in the meantime had walked out to the box.
It was a tribute to the admiration that was felt
for him by fans everywhere that even the Chicago
partisans welcomed his coming with a hearty round
of applause. He was more than a Giant standby.
He was the idol of all true lovers of the national
game.</p>

<p>Burton, the heaviest slugger on the Chicago
team, was first at bat. Joe looked him over and
then sent the ball over for a perfect strike. It
came in like a bullet. Burton did not even offer
at it.</p>

<p>“Strike one!” called the umpire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The next one had a fast hop on it, and Burton
swung six inches beneath it.</p>

<p>“Strike two!”</p>

<p>Burton set himself for the next one, and succeeded
only in fouling it off. Mylert got the ball
and returned it to Joe on the bound. The latter
caught it carelessly and then, without his usual
wind-up, sent it whistling across the plate. It
caught Burton entirely off his guard, and his futile
stab at it caused even the Chicago fans to break
into laughter.</p>

<p>“Out!” cried the umpire, and the discomfited
Burton retired sheepishly to the bench.</p>

<p>“That’s showing them up, Joe,” called up Larry
Barrett from second.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you soak that first ball?” demanded
Evans, the Chicago manager. “It was a
beauty, right in the groove.”</p>

<p>“Aw,” growled Burton, “how can I hit a ball
that I can’t see? That came like a shot from a
rifle. I ain’t no miracle man.”</p>

<p>Gallagher came next and had no better luck.
One strike was called on him, and the other two
he missed.</p>

<p>“Look at that boy, John,” exulted Robbie, his
red face beaming. “He’s got them fellows buffaloed
right from the jump. He’s making them
eat out of his hand. He’s skinning ’em alive.”</p>

<p>“Fine work,” agreed McRae, his anxious features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
relaxing somewhat. “’Twas the best day’s
work I ever did when I got him on the team.
He’s a whole nine by himself. And&mdash;blistering
billikens! Look at that!”</p>

<p>The “that” was a hot liner that Weston had
sent right over the box. Like a flash Joe had
leaped into the air and speared it with his gloved
hand. The force of the hit was so great that it
knocked him down, but he came up smiling with
the ball in his hand.</p>

<p>There was a moment of stupefied silence, and
then the stands rocked with applause, contributed
by the Cub as well as the Giant rooters. That
play alone was worth the price of admission.</p>

<p>Joe drew off his glove and came in from the
box, while the Chicagos ran out to take their places
in the field.</p>

<p>“Great stuff, Joe,” cried Jim jubilantly, as he
hit his chum a resounding whack on the shoulder.
“They didn’t have a chance. Keep it up and
you’ll have those Cubs crawling into their hole and
licking their wounds.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will do for a start,” said Joe, modestly.
“But that’s only one inning out of nine, and those
fellows may break loose any time. But if our
fellows will only give me a run or two, I’ll try to
hold them down.”</p>

<p>But the wished-for runs did not materialize in
the Giants’ second turn at bat. Wheeler made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
strong bid for a run when he sent the ball on a
high line between right and center, but the Chicago
rightfielder was off at the crack of the bat and
just managed to get his hands on the ball and shut
off what seemed to have all the earmarks of a
homer. It was a sparkling catch and evoked
rounds of applause from the Chicago rooters.</p>

<p>McGuire dribbled a slow one to the box that
Axander had no trouble in getting to first on time.
Renton was an easy victim on strikes.</p>

<p>“Looks as if you’d have to win your own game,
Joe,” grumbled McRae. “These boobs have more
holes in their bats than a chunk of Swiss cheese.”</p>

<p>In the Cubs’ half Joe mowed them down as fast
as they came to the bat. His curve and hop ball
were working to perfection. He varied his fast
and slow ones with such cunning that he had his
opponents up in the air. It was just a procession
of bewildered batters to the plate and then back
to the bench. It looked as though Joe were in for
one of the best days of his brilliant career.</p>

<p>In the third inning the Giants at last broke the
ice. Barrett lay down a well-placed bunt along
the third base line that the Cub third baseman
got all mixed up on in his efforts to field. When
at last he did get his hands on it he threw wild,
and Barrett easily reached second before the ball
was retrieved.</p>

<p>It looked like the possible beginning of a rally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and instantly all was commotion on the Giants’
bench. McRae himself ran out to the coaching
line near first, while he sent Jim over to third.
The Giant players began a line of chatter designed
to rattle the Cub pitcher.</p>

<p>But Axander only smiled as he took up his position
in the box. He was too much of a veteran
to let his opponents get him fussed. But his smile,
though it did not entirely disappear, lost some of
its brightness when he saw that Baseball Joe was
the next man to face him.</p>

<p>Cries of encouragement rose from Joe’s mates
and from the Giant rooters in the stands.</p>

<p>“Oh, you home-run slugger!”</p>

<p>“Give the ball a ride!”</p>

<p>“Show him where you live!”</p>

<p>“Send it to kingdom come!”</p>

<p>Amid the babel of cries, Joe took up his position
at the plate. His brain was alert and his nerves
like steel.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Matson, but I’ll have to strike you out,”
said Axander, with a grin. “All Giants look alike
to me to-day. Giant killer is my middle name.”</p>

<p>“Don’t waste any sympathy on me,” retorted
Joe. “You can send flowers to my funeral later
on. But first give me a chance at the ball.”</p>

<p>Axander wound up and put one over the corner
of the plate with all the force he could muster.
Joe caught it near the end of his bat and sent it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
soaring out toward rightfield. It was a mighty
clout, but when it came down it was just about six
inches on the wrong side of the foul line.</p>

<p>Joe, who was well on his way to second, came
back and again took up his position at the bat.</p>

<p>But that tremendous hit had given Axander
food for thought. The next ball that came over
was so wide of the plate that the catcher had to
jump for it.</p>

<p>Another ball followed in the same place, and
the stands began to murmur.</p>

<p>“He’s afraid to let him hit it!”</p>

<p>“He’s going to walk him!”</p>

<p>“Matson’s got his goat!”</p>

<p>But Axander had resolved to play safe, and the
next ball was so wide that it was plain he was
doing it with deliberate design.</p>

<p>“Thought you were a giant killer,” jeered Joe.
“Have you lost your nerve? I can see from here
you’re trembling.”</p>

<p>Stung by the taunt, Axander put all the stuff
he had on the ball and sent in a swift incurve.</p>

<p>Joe timed it perfectly. There was a terrific
crash as the bat met the ball, and the next instant
Joe had dropped the bat and was running to first
like a deer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THROWN AWAY</small></h2>


<p>On went the ball almost on a dead line to center,
but rising as it went as though it were endowed
with wings. On and still on, as though it would
never stop. The centerfielder had cast one look
at it, and then he turned and ran toward the distant
bleachers in the back of the field. He took
another look over his shoulder and then threw up
his hands in a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>The ball cleared the bleacher rail, still going
strong, and finally came to rest in the top row,
where it was hastily gobbled up and concealed by
an enthusiastic bleacherite, anxious to retain a
memento of one of the longest hits ever made on
the Chicago grounds.</p>

<p>Joe rounded first, going like a railroad train,
but as he saw where the ball was going he moderated
his speed in order to conserve his wind and
just jogged around the bases until he reached the
plate, where Barrett had preceded him.</p>

<p>Again and again he was forced to doff his cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in response to the shouts of the crowd, who had
forgotten all partisanship for the moment in the
excitement of that mighty homer. And his teammates
mauled and pounded him until he laughingly
made them desist, and made his way to the bench,
where McRae and Robbie were beaming.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thirty years in baseball, Joe,” said
McRae, “and I’ve seen lots of home runs. But
if any one of them was finer than that whale of a
hit, I’ve forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t been for the bleachers in the way,
the ball would be going yet,” grinned Robbie.
“That swat will break Axander’s heart.”</p>

<p>But the heart of the Cub pitcher was made of
stouter material than Robbie gave it credit for,
and Axander settled down and prevented further
scoring for that inning. But the Giants had two
runs to the good, and the way Joe was pitching
made those two runs look as big as a house.</p>

<p>For the next two and a half innings the game
developed into a pitchers’ duel. Neither side was
able to tally, although a scratch hit put a Giant
on first and a passed ball advanced him to second.
It seemed quite possible that the game would end
with the score still two to none.</p>

<p>Joe came up again in the sixth, amid cries by
the Giant rooters to repeat. But Axander was
going to take no more chances. The memory of
that screaming homer still lingered. The catcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
stood wide of the plate, and Axander deliberately
pitched four bad balls, regardless of the jeers of
the crowd.</p>

<p>It was the finest kind of a compliment to Joe’s
prowess, but he was not looking for compliments.
What he wanted was another crack at the ball.
There was no help for it, however, and he dropped
his bat and trotted down to first.</p>

<p>He watched Axander like a hawk, took a long
lead off the bag, and on the second ball pitched
started to steal second. He would have made it
without difficulty, but the Cub catcher threw the
ball to the right of the bag, and the second baseman,
in order to grab it, had to get in the way of
Joe. There was a mix-up as they came together,
and both went down. The baseman dropped the
ball, and Joe managed to get his hand on the base
before the ball could be recovered.</p>

<p>But when Joe attempted to get up on his feet,
his left leg gave way under him, and he had to
steady himself by catching hold of Holstein, the
second baseman. The latter looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>“Trying to kid me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Joe. “My leg’s gone back
on me. Must have wrenched or twisted it, I guess,
when we came together.”</p>

<p>The umpire saw that something had happened
and called time, while McRae, Robbie, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
other men on the Giant team gathered around
their injured comrade in alarm and consternation.</p>

<p>“Nothing broken, is there, Joe?” cried McRae,
as he came running out to second.</p>

<p>“Nothing so bad as that,” answered Joe, summoning
up a smile. “Guess it’s only a sprain.
But I’m afraid it puts me out of the running for
to-day. I can scarcely bear my weight on it.”</p>

<p>The club trainer, Dougherty, ran his hands
over Joe with the dexterity of an expert.</p>

<p>“No breaks,” he pronounced. “But a wrench
to the leg and the ankle sprained. No more work
for you, Joe, for a week, at least. Here, some of
you fellows help me get him over to the clubhouse.”</p>

<p>“Maybe after a little rest and rubbing I can
go on with the pitching,” suggested Joe.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” replied Dougherty, laconically.
“Get that right out of your noddle. Your
work’s done for the day.”</p>

<p>A rookie was put on second to run for Joe, and
the latter was assisted to the clubhouse, where
Dougherty and his assistants set to work on the
leg and ankle at once.</p>

<p>Gloom so thick that it could have been cut with
a knife came down on the Giants’ bench. Here
was another proof that the “jinx” was still camping
on their trail.</p>

<p>But there was no time for grizzling then, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the game had to go on. Jim and Markwith were
sent out to warm up, while the Giants finished their
half of the inning.</p>

<p>Joe’s hit had not gone for nothing, for Ledwith,
the rookie, got to third on a fielder’s choice,
and came home on a long sacrifice fly to center.
Iredell swung viciously at the ball and sent up a
towering skyscraper that Axander was waiting for
when it came down. The inning was over, and,
despite the injury to their star pitcher, another
run had been stowed away in the Giants’ bat bag.</p>

<p>McRae selected Jim to finish the game in his
chum’s place.</p>

<p>“Go to it, Barclay, and show them what stuff
you’re made of,” admonished the manager. “The
boys have given you a lead of three runs, and all
you’ve got to do is to hold those birds down.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pitch my head off to do it,” promised Jim.</p>

<p>He only permitted three men to face him in the
Chicago’s sixth inning. All the attempts of the
Cub coaches and players to rattle him at the send-off
resulted in failure.</p>

<p>Mollocher, the first Cub at bat, let a speeder
go past because it was a trifle wide. The next
was a slow curve that the umpire called a strike.
Mollocher looked surprised, but apart from glaring
at the umpire made no protest. He laced out
at the next one and fouled it to the top of the
grandstand for a second strike. The next ball he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hit on the upper side, and it went for a harmless
hopper to Barrett, who fielded him out at first.</p>

<p>Greaves, who came next, refused to offer at the
first, which was high and went as a ball. The next
cut the plate for a strike. He fouled the next two
in succession, and finally sent a looping fly to Renton
at third.</p>

<p>Lasker stood like a wooden man as Jim sent
over a beauty for the first strike. The second
came over below his knees, and was a ball. He
struck at the next and missed, and then Jim fanned
him with a slow outcurve that he almost broke
his back in reaching for.</p>

<p>It was good pitching, and showed that the
Giants had more than one string to their bow.
The score was now 3 to 0 on even innings, and,
with only three more innings to go, it looked as
though the Giants were due to break their long
run of hard luck.</p>

<p>“You’re doing fine, Jim,” encouraged Robbie.
“Just keep that up and we’ll not only beat ’em but
rub it in by giving ’em a row of goose eggs.”</p>

<p>“Knock wood,” cautioned McRae, giving three
sharp raps with his knuckles on the bench. “For
the love of Pete, Robbie, cut out that kind of talk.
The game isn’t over yet by a long shot.”</p>

<p>Axander, as cool as an iceberg, put on extra
speed and set down the Giants in their half in one,
two, three order. Not a man reached first, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the last two were disposed of by the strike-out
route.</p>

<p>“Stretch” was the word that ran through the
stands as the Chicagos came in for their half of
the “lucky seventh,” and the crowd rose as one
man and stretched while cries of encouragement
went up for their favorites.</p>

<p>The charm failed this time, however, for though
they gathered one hit off Jim, it counted for nothing,
as the next three went out in succession. Jim
was certainly pitching airtight ball.</p>

<p>But in the latter half of the eighth, after the
Giants had failed to add to their score, there came
one of the sudden changes that illustrated once
more the uncertainty of the national game.</p>

<p>The head of the Cubs’ batting order was up,
and their supporters were frantically urging them
to do something.</p>

<p>Burton did his best, and sent up a high fly to
Curry at right. It looked as though it were made
to order for the latter, who did not have to budge
from his tracks. The ball came down directly in
his hands&mdash;and he dropped it!</p>

<p>A mighty roar went up from the crowd, who
had looked upon it as an easy out, which it should
have been, and Burton, who had slowed up a little,
put on speed, rounded first and started for second.</p>

<p>Curry, rattled by his error, fumbled at the ball,
and when he did recover it lined it in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of second. But it went wide of Barrett, and
though Jim, who was backing him up, caught and
returned it, Burton was already on the bag.</p>

<p>Gallagher, the next man up, popped a Texas
leaguer that Burkett and Barrett ran out for.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it,” cried Barrett.</p>

<p>“It’s mine,” shouted the burly first baseman.</p>

<p>Each unfortunately believed the other and held
back, waiting for his comrade to make the catch.
As a result, the ball dropped between them and
rolled some distance away.</p>

<p>Burton, who had held the bag, started for third.
Burkett retrieved the ball and without getting set
hurled it to third. It went high over Renton’s
head and rolled to the stands. Burton kept right
on and crossed the plate for the first run of the
game. Gallagher, in the general excitement,
reached second.</p>

<p>Pandemonium broke loose among the Chicago
rooters.</p>

<p>“We’ve got them going!” was the cry.</p>

<p>“All over but the shouting!”</p>

<p>Evans, the Chicago manager, sent in his best
pinch hitter, Miller, and put a fast rookie, Houghton,
on second to run in the place of Gallagher,
who was of the ice-wagon type.</p>

<p>To give his comrades time to recover somewhat
from their demoralization, Jim stooped down to
lace his shoe. He was a long time doing this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and then was very deliberate in taking his place
on the mound.</p>

<p>He whizzed over a high fast one that Miller
struck at and missed. The next he fouled off.
The third just missed cutting the corner of the
plate, and it went for a ball. On the next, Miller
lay down a bunt that rolled slowly along the third
base line.</p>

<p>It looked as though it were going to roll foul,
and Renton gave it a chance to do so. However,
it kept on the inside of the line, and by the time
Renton had gathered it up, Miller had easily
reached first.</p>

<p>Wallace went to the bat with orders to wait
Jim out, trusting to the hope that the latter would
by this time be rattled, because the breaks of the
game seemed to be going against him. But when
two beauties in succession cut the corners of the
plate for strikes, while he stood there like a
wooden Indian, he changed his mind.</p>

<p>To make him hit into a double play, Jim made
the next an outcurve. Nine times out of ten the
batter hits that kind of ball into the dirt. It ran
according to form this time also. Wallace hit a
grounder that went straight to Larry Barrett at
second. Larry set himself for the ball, while Iredell
ran over to cover the bag for a double play.</p>

<p>But just before the ball reached Barrett, it took
a high bound, went over his head and rolled out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
into centerfield. Gallagher scored, Miller reached
third, and Wallace got to second on a long slide,
just escaping being nipped by McGuire’s return
of the ball.</p>

<p>With two runs in, no one out, and a man each on
second and third, it looked bad for the Giants.
A single hit would probably score both of the
occupants of the bags. Even two outfield sacrifice
flies would do it.</p>

<p>The din was tremendous as the crowds yelled
in chorus, trying to rattle the already shaky visiting
team. But the noise subsided somewhat as
Jim put on steam and set down Mollocher on three
successive strikes.</p>

<p>Greaves came up next, and lashed out at the
first ball pitched, sending a grasser toward first.
Burkett made a good pick-up, stepped on the bag,
putting out Greaves, and then hurled to Mylert to
catch Miller, who was legging it to the plate.
But although Mylert made a mighty leap, the ball
went over his head and before it could be recovered
both Miller and Wallace had crossed the
plate, making the score four to three in favor of
the Chicagos.</p>

<p>And the Chicago rooters promptly went mad!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>FROM BAD TO WORSE</small></h2>


<p>That nightmare inning came to an end without
further scoring, as Jim struck out Lasker on four
pitched balls. Then, with a sigh of relief, Jim
pulled off his glove and went in to the bench, while
a sheepish and disgruntled lot of Giants followed
him in for their last inning. McRae was white
with anger, and had no hesitation in telling the
team what he thought of them.</p>

<p>“You bunch of four-flushers!” he stormed.
“Throwing the ball all around the lot like a gang
of schoolboys. You fellows are Giants&mdash;I don’t
think. You’re a disgrace to your uniforms. You’re
drawing your salaries on false pretenses. Letting
those fellows get four runs in a single inning without
making a real hit. What do you want the
pitcher to do&mdash;strike out every man that comes
to the bat, while you go to sleep in the field? You
make me tired. You ought to join the Ladies’
Bloomer League. And even then Maggie Murphy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
team would put it all over you. Go in there
now and get those runs back.”</p>

<p>With their faces burning from the tongue lashing
of their irate manager, the Giants went in for
their last inning.</p>

<p>Larry was first up and cracked out a sharp single
to right that looked at first as though he might
stretch it to a double, but it was so smartly relayed
that he found it advisable to scramble back
to the initial bag.</p>

<p>Jim was next up. The first two balls pitched
were wide of the plate and he refused to bite.
The next one, however, he caught right on the
seam for a liner that went whistling into right for
a double.</p>

<p>Larry had started at the crack of the bat, and
had rounded second by the time Jim got to first.
He kept on to third, where Iredell was on the
coaching line. There he should have been retained,
for Burton, who was renowned for his
throwing arm, had by this time got the ball and
was setting himself for the throw. Iredell, however,
urged Larry on, with the consequence that
when he slid into the plate the ball was there waiting
for him. Jim, in the meantime, had reached
second.</p>

<p>Larry picked himself up, brushed himself off and
went to the bench, muttering growls against Iredell
for having egged him on. Had two men been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
out there might have been some excuse for taking
the chance. But with none out, it was almost certain
that, either by a hit or a sacrifice, he could
have been brought in with the run that would have
tied the score.</p>

<p>Mylert tried to kill the ball, but hit it on the
under side and it went up in a high fly that was
easily gobbled up by the Cubs’ first baseman.</p>

<p>Curry, the last hope of the Giants, came to the
bat. He was in a frenzy of eagerness to redeem
himself, as it was his inglorious muff that had
started the Cubs on their way to those four unearned
runs.</p>

<p>Axander himself was beginning to feel the
strain, and was a bit wild. Curry looked them
over carefully and let the bad ones go by. A
couple of good ones were sandwiched in, at which
he swung and missed.</p>

<p>With three balls and two strikes, both pitcher
and batter were “in the hole.” Axander had to
put the next one over under penalty of passing the
batter. And if Curry missed the next good one,
the game was over.</p>

<p>Axander wound up and let one go straight for
the plate. Curry caught it full and fair and the
ball soared off toward left.</p>

<p>Weston, the Cub leftfielder, was off with the
crack of the ball, running in the direction the
latter was taking. It seemed like a hopeless quest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
but he kept on, and just as the ball was going over
his head he made a tremendous leap and caught
it with one hand. He was off balance and turned
a complete somersault, but when he came up he
still had hold of the ball. It was a catch such as
is seldom seen more than two or three times in a
season.</p>

<p>The game was over, and the Cubs had triumphed
by a score of 4 runs to 3. The crowd
swarmed down on the diamond to surround and
applaud their favorites, who had plucked victory
from the very jaws of defeat, or, to put it more
correctly, had accepted the game which the Giants
had generously handed over to them.</p>

<p>It was a sore and dejected band of Giants that
made their way to the clubhouse. The end had
come so suddenly that they could hardly realize
what had happened. Some were inclined to blame
the “jinx,” but the more intelligent knew that their
own errors and those of some of their comrades
had alone brought about their downfall. The defeat
was all the more exasperating, because they
had had superb pitching throughout&mdash;pitching
that would have won nine games out of ten and
would certainly have won that one if their twirlers
had been given half-way decent support.</p>

<p>“Hard luck, Jim,” was Joe’s greeting to his
comrade, as the latter came in and made ready
for the showers. “You pitched a dandy game.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
It’s tough when four runs come in without one of
them being earned.”</p>

<p>“All in a day’s work,” replied Jim, affecting a
cheerfulness that he was far from feeling. “But
you’re the one I’m worrying about. How’s that
leg and foot?”</p>

<p>“Dougherty says it will be all right in a week,”
replied Joe. “He’s rubbed most of the soreness
out of them, but I’ll have to favor them for a
while.”</p>

<p>“Glory be!” exclaimed Jim with fervor. “If
you were out of the game for a long time it would
be all up with the Giants. Then they’d go to
pieces for fair.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” disclaimed Joe. “It’s too
great a team to be dependent on any one man.
I’m only just one cog in a fine machine.”</p>

<p>“Looked like a rather wobbly machine this
afternoon,” said Jim, ruefully.</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Joe. “The boys did play like
a bunch of hams. But every team does that once
in a while. The boys will shake off this slump,
and then they’ll begin to climb. Remember that
time when we won twenty-six straight? What
we’ve done once, we can do again. I’m not a
seventh son of a seventh son, but I have a hunch
that we’re just about due to do that very thing.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’re as good a prophet as you are a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
pitcher,” replied Jim, grinning. He was beginning
to find Joe’s optimism contagious.</p>

<p>Their conversation was interrupted by the coming
of McRae. A sudden silence fell over the
occupants of the clubhouse, for they knew the
danger signals, and a glance at the manager’s face
told them that a storm was brewing.</p>

<p>“Giants!” exclaimed McRae, and they winced
at the bitter sarcasm in his tone. “Where have I
heard that word before? A fine bunch of pennant
winners! Why, you couldn’t win the pennant in
the Podunk League. Put you up against a gang
of bushers, and they’d laugh themselves to death.
Any high school nine would make you look foolish.
Giants? Dwarfs, pigmies, runts! Easy
meat for any team you come across! Champions
of the world? Cellar champions! Sub-cellar
champions! Just keep on this way, and the other
teams will bury you so deep you’ll be coming out
in China. I’m going to change my name. I’m
ashamed to be known as the manager of such a
bunch of dubs.”</p>

<p>Nobody ventured to interrupt the tirade, partly
because they felt that he was justified in his anger
and partly because no one cared to play the part
of lightning rod. When McRae was in that mood,
it was best to let him talk himself out.</p>

<p>From the general roast he came down to particulars.
He glared around and singled out Curry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
That hapless individual evaded his glance and pretended
to be very busy in tying his shoe.</p>

<p>“You’re the one that started that bunch of
errors in the eighth inning,” McRae shouted,
pointing an accusing finger at him.</p>

<p>“Aw,” muttered Curry, “any one can make a
muff once in a while.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t for the muff I’m calling you down,”
retorted McRae. “I know that can happen to any
man, and I never roast any one for it. Why, we
lost the World’s championship one year in Boston
when Rodgrass made that muff in centerfield. I
never said a word to him about it, and in the next
year’s contract I raised his salary. What I’m
panning you for is that rotten throw that followed
the muff. That’s when you lost your head. You
could easily have caught Burton at second and
stopped the rally.</p>

<p>“And you, Burkett,” he went on, turning to the
first baseman. “For a man who calls himself a
major leaguer, you certainly went the limit this
afternoon. Don’t you get sleep enough at night
that you have to go to sleep on first? And those
wild throws, one over Renton’s head and the other
over Mylert’s. Oh, what’s the use,” he continued,
throwing his hands in the air. “I’ve got a doctor
on this club that can take care of any bone in the
leg or bone in the arm, but he can’t do anything
with bones in the head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>If they thought he had worn himself out, they
were greatly mistaken. He turned to Iredell.</p>

<p>“Come outside, Iredell,” he said, “I want to
have a word with you.”</p>

<p>Once outside the clubhouse, he turned a grim
face on the captain.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to call you down before your
men, Iredell,” he snapped, “because I didn’t care
to weaken the discipline of the team&mdash;that is, if
there’s any discipline left in the club. But I
want to tell you that if your work to-day is a
sample of the way you captain the team, why,
the sooner there’s a change in captains the better.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know just what you mean,” muttered
Iredell, an angry red suffusing his face.</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well what I mean,” declared
McRae. “How about that ball that fell
to the ground between Larry and Burkett? Either
one of them could have got it. Why didn’t they?”</p>

<p>Iredell remained silent, fingering his cap.</p>

<p>“Because you didn’t call out which was to take
it,” McRae himself supplied the answer. “Their
eyes were on the ball, and when each said he could
get it each left it to the other. All you had to do
was to call out the name of one of them, and he’d
have got it. That’s what you’re captain for&mdash;to
use your judgment in a pinch.</p>

<p>“Then there was that rotten coaching at third
base,” McRae went on with his indictment. “Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
didn’t you hold Larry there? You know what a
terror Burton is on long throws to the plate and
that he’d probably get him. With nobody out, it
was a cinch that one of the next three batsmen
would have brought Larry in. And with him
dancing around third, he might have got Axander’s
goat. Then, too, the infield would have been
drawn in for a play at the plate, and that would
have given a better chance for a hit to the outfield.
Am I right or am I wrong?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re right,” conceded Iredell.
“But a fellow can’t always think of everything.
If Larry had got to the plate, you’d be patting
me on the back.”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t,” snapped McRae, “because it
would have been just fool’s luck. Why, I fined
a man twenty-five dollars once for knocking out
a home run when I had ordered him to bunt. That
he came across with a home run didn’t change the
fact that at that point in the game a bunt was the
proper thing, and nine times out of ten would
have gone through. You’ve got to use your sense
and judgment and do the thing that seems most
likely to bring home the bacon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to please you these days, no matter
what I do,” said Iredell sullenly.</p>

<p>“You’ll only please me when you do things
right,” returned McRae. “You know as well as
any one else that I never ride my men. I’ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a ball player myself as well as manager, and I
can put myself in the place of both. But what I
want are men who are quick in the head as well
as the feet. Give me the choice between a fast
thinker and a fast runner, and I’ll take the fast
thinker every time. Look at Joe Matson, the way
he shot that ball over on Burton to-day before he
knew where he was at. He’s always doing something
of that kind&mdash;outguessing the other fellow.
His think tank is working every minute. He puts
out as many men with his head as he does with
his arm. And that’s what makes him the greatest
pitcher in this country to-day, bar none.</p>

<p>“Now, take it from me, Iredell, that’s the kind
of thinking that’s going to pull this team out of
the mud. I’m paying you a good salary to play
shortstop. There, you’re delivering the goods.
But I’ve tacked a couple of thousands onto your
salary to act as captain. There, you’re not delivering
the goods. And those goods have got to
be delivered, or, by ginger, I’ll know the reason
why!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>A STARTLING SUGGESTION</small></h2>


<p>With this ultimatum, the irate manager stalked
off to join Robbie, while Iredell, his face like a
thunder cloud, returned to the clubhouse.</p>

<p>Nor was his wrath at the “roasting” he had
received at the hands of McRae lessened by the
consciousness that it was deserved. He knew in
his heart that he had neglected his duties, or, at
least, had failed to take advantage of his opportunities.
The game might have been won if he
had been on the job. To be sure, the team had
played like a lot of bushers, but that did not relieve
him of his responsibility. It was when they
were playing badly that it was up to him to step
into the breach. And that was what he had lamentably
failed to do.</p>

<p>“Look at the face of him,” whispered Larry
to Wheeler. “The old man has been giving him
the rough edge of his tongue.”</p>

<p>“And when that tongue gets going it can certainly
flay a man alive,” remarked Wheeler. “I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
sore yet from what he gave the bunch of us. Let’s
hurry and get out of this. It’s too much like a
funeral around here to suit me.”</p>

<p>McRae in the meantime was unburdening his
heart to Robbie. The latter was his closest friend
and adviser. They had been teammates in the
early days on the old Orioles of Baltimore, when
that famous team had been burning up the League.
Both of them knew baseball from beginning to
end. Together they had worked out most of the
inside stuff, such as the delayed steal, the hit and
run, and other clever bits of strategy that had
now become the common property of all up-to-date
major-league teams.</p>

<p>Yet, though as close friends as brothers, they
were as different in temperament as two men could
be. Robbie caught his flies with molasses. McRae
relied on vinegar to catch his. Robbie knew
how to salve the umpires. McRae was on their
backs clawing like a wildcat. McRae ruffled up
the feathers of his men, while Robbie smoothed
them down. Each had his own special qualities
and defects. But both were square and just and
upright, and commanded the respect of the members
of the team. Together they formed an ideal
combination, whose worth was attested by the way
they had led the Giants to victory. Into that wonderful
team they had put the fighting spirit, the
indefinable something that made them the “class”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the League and more than once the champions
of the world. Even when they failed to win the
pennant, they were always close to the top, and
it was usually the Giants that the winning team
had to beat.</p>

<p>Just now, however, the Giants were undeniably
in the slump that at times will come to the best of
teams, and both McRae and Robbie, who were
hard losers, were at their wits’ end to know how to
get them out of it.</p>

<p>“We’re up against it for fair, Robbie,” said
McRae, as they walked to the gate on their way
to the hotel at which the Giants were stopping.
“Think of the way the Chicagos are giving us
the merry ha ha! We just gave them that game
to-day. Looked as though we had it sewed up
for fair. People had started to leave their seats,
thinking it was all over. Then we turn around
and hand the game over to them.”</p>

<p>“It’s tough luck, to be sure,” Robbie agreed.
“If Matson hadn’t been hurt, we’d have copped it
sure. They couldn’t get within a mile of him.
And now as the capsheaf, he’s probably out of the
game for a week. But cheer up, Mac. The season’s
young yet, and we’ve got out of many a worse
hole than this.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t so much the boys going to pieces in
that one inning that makes me so sore,” returned
the manager. “Any team will get a case of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
rattles once in a while and play like a lot of dubs.
What gets my goat are the blunders that Iredell
made. As a captain, supposed to use his brains,
he did well&mdash;I don’t think.”</p>

<p>“It was rotten judgment,” agreed Robbie,
thoughtfully. “And what makes it worse is that
it isn’t the first time it’s happened. He’s overlooked
a lot of things since we started on this trip.
Some of them have been trifling and haven’t done
much damage. Some of them the spectators
wouldn’t notice at all. But you’ve seen them and
I’ve seen them.”</p>

<p>“And what’s worse, some of the team have seen
them,” returned McRae. “That’s taken some of
their confidence away from them and made them
shaky. A captain is a good deal like a pitcher.
If he’s good, the team play behind him like thoroughbreds.
If he’s poor, they play like a lot of
selling platers. I shouldn’t wonder if that’s the
whole secret of this present slump.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right, John,” assented Robbie.
“We’ll have to coach Iredell, wise him up on
the inside stuff, and see if he doesn’t do better.”</p>

<p>McRae shook his head.</p>

<p>“That won’t do the trick,” he replied. “A good
captain is born, not made. He’s got to have the
gray matter in his noddle to start with. If he
hasn’t got it, all the coaching in the world won’t
put it into him. It’s a matter of brains, first, last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and all the time. I’ve come to the conclusion that
Iredell hasn’t got them. He’s got a ball player’s
brains. But he hasn’t got a captain’s brains, and
that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, admitting that that’s so, we seem to be
up against it,” mused Robbie, ruefully. “Who else
on the team is any better in that respect? Run
over the list. Mylert, Burkett, Barrett, Jackwell,
Curry, Bowen, Wheeler. I don’t know that any
one of them has anything on Iredell in the matter
of sense and judgment.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you overlooked some one?” asked
McRae, significantly.</p>

<p>Robbie looked at him in wonderment.</p>

<p>“Nobody except the substitutes,” he said. “And
of course they’re out of the question.”</p>

<p>“How about the box?” asked McRae.</p>

<p>“Oh, the pitchers!” returned Robbie. “I didn’t
take them into consideration. But of course a
pitcher can’t be captain. That goes without
saying.”</p>

<p>“Not with me it doesn’t go without saying,”
said McRae. “Why can’t a pitcher act as captain?”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why,” stammered Robbie, “just because
it isn’t done. I don’t remember a case where it
ever was done.”</p>

<p>“That cuts no ice with me at all,” declared
McRae, incisively. “Whatever success I’ve had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in the world has been got by doing things that
aren’t done. How was it that we made the old
Orioles the class of the League and the wonder
of the baseball world? By doing the things that
aren’t done&mdash;that no other team had thought of.
They went along in the old groove, playing cut
and dried baseball. We went after them like a
whirlwind with a raft of new ideas, and before
they knew where they were at, we had their
shirts.”</p>

<p>“Wriggling snakes!” exclaimed Robbie, his face
lighting up, as he gave his friend a resounding
slap on the back. “Mac, you’ve got me going.
You’re the same old Mac, always getting up something
new. Matson, of course! Joe Matson, not
only the greatest pitcher, but the brainiest man
in all baseball! Matson, who thinks like lightning.
Matson, that the whole team worships.
Matson, who can give any one cards and spades
and beat him out. Mac, you old rascal, you take
my breath away. You’ve hit the bull’s-eye.”</p>

<p>McRae smiled his gratification.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Robbie, but you needn’t go
knocking me down with that ham of a hand of
yours,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“Have you mentioned the matter to Joe yet?”
asked Robbie, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied the manager. “I wouldn’t
do that anyway until I had talked the matter over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with you and learned what you thought of it.
And then, too, with that bruised leg and ankle of
his, he won’t be in the game for a week or so,
anyway. So you really cotton to the idea, do
you?”</p>

<p>“I fall for it like a load of bricks,” was the
response. “Of course, Matson’s yet to be heard
from. It’s a pretty heavy responsibility to be
placed on a man that’s already carrying the team
along with his wonderful pitching. Perhaps he’ll
think it’s a little too much to ask of him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take a chance on that,” replied McRae,
confidently. “He’s got a marvelous physique, and
he always keeps himself in the best of condition.
He’s strong enough to carry any load that he’s
asked to bear. Then, too, you know how he’s
wrapt up in the success of the team. He’s never
balked yet at anything I’ve asked him to do. He’s
playing baseball not only for money, but because
he loves it. He talks baseball, thinks baseball,
eats baseball, dreams baseball. He’s hep to every
fine point in the game and he’s on the job every
second. And when it comes to thinking fast and
acting quickly&mdash;well, you know as well as I do
that nobody can touch him.”</p>

<p>“He’s a wizard, all right,” agreed Robbie.
“But here’s a point to be thought over, John. A
captain’s got to be in every game. Joe pitches
perhaps two games a week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve thought of that, too,” McRae replied.
“On the days he’s not in the box, he can play in
the outfield. And think of the batting strength
that will add to the team. He’s liable to break up
any game with one of the same kind of homers he
knocked out to-day. He’s as much of a wonder
with the bat as he is in the box, and that’s going
some.”</p>

<p>“Better and better,” declared Robbie, exultantly.
“Mac, I take off my hat to you. You’ve
hit on an idea that’s going to win the pennant of
the League this season, with the World Series
thrown in for good measure. Who cares for to-day’s
game? Who cares if the Giants are in a
slump? Just make Joe Matson captain of the
team and then see the Giants climb!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>PERPLEXING PROBLEMS</small></h2>


<p>“I hope you’re right, Robbie,” replied McRae,
“and I believe you are. But not a word about
this to anybody yet until we’ve mulled it over in
our minds from every angle and are ready to
spring it. I don’t want Iredell to get any inkling
of it yet, for then perhaps he’d get sullen and indifferent
and things will be even worse than they
are now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it under my hat,” promised Robbie.
“How do you think Iredell’s going to take it?
He’s an ugly sort of customer, you know, when he
gets roiled.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’ll be easy enough to handle,” returned
McRae. “I’ll let him down easy and heal
his wounds with a little increase in salary. But
whether he does or not, I’m not going to let any
one’s personal ambitions stand in the way of the
success of the team. That comes before anything.”</p>

<p>“Well now, to change the subject,” said Robbie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
“who are we going to put in the box to-morrow?
We’ve got to have that game, or the
Chicagos will have a clean sweep of the series.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to depend on Markwith,”
replied McRae. “The Chicagos have never been
able to do much against his southpaw slants.
Other things being equal, I’d put Barclay in the
box. But he pitched the last part of to-day’s
game, and perhaps it will be too soon to ask him
to repeat. Even at that I may take a chance.
I’ll see how they warm up before the game.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad that Matson was hurt in to-day’s
game,” remarked Robbie. “We were counting on
him to take at least two games from St. Louis.
Barclay, perhaps, could take another. Three out
of four would help us some in winding up the
trip. But if they trim us, too, as all the other
Western teams have done, I’ll hate to go back and
face the New York fans.”</p>

<p>“I’ll work Jim in two of them,” said McRae.
“Markwith, Bradley and Merton will have to help
him out. Possibly Joe will be in shape for the
last game. And maybe the team will take a brace
and wake up. At any rate, we can only hope.
There isn’t much nourishment in hope, but it’s all
we’ve got.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, Jim and Joe had finished their
dressing and were preparing to leave the clubhouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Jackwell and Bowen were the only occupants
left in the place. They were sitting in a corner
engaged in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“How is the leg, Matson?” asked Bowen, as the
two chums passed near them.</p>

<p>“None too good,” returned Joe. “But it doesn’t
feel as sore as I feel inside to see that game go
flooey. Pity you fellows weren’t in it. McGuire
and Renton weren’t so bad in the field, but they’re
not as good stickers as you fellows, and your bats
might have turned the tide. By the way, are you
feeling any better now?”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” answered Jackwell, a little confusedly.</p>

<p>“I’m not feeling exactly up to snuff,” said
Bowen. “But I guess I’ll be able to go in to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Ptomaine poisoning’s a pretty bad thing,”
said Joe, looking at them rather quizzically. “It
usually hangs on for days. You’re lucky to get
over it so quickly.”</p>

<p>“You look fit as a fiddle,” added Jim, dryly.
“Or is it the hectic flush of disease that gives you
such a good color?”</p>

<p>“I guess it was only a slight attack,” said Jackwell.
“Just enough to put us out of our stride
for the day.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to get to the hotel and get there
quickly,” declared Joe, a twinge going through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
his foot as he stepped down from the threshold of
the clubhouse. “Mabel will be at the hotel, wondering
what on earth has happened to me.”</p>

<p>“By jiminy, that’s so!” cried Jim, turning to
stare at his chum. “What will you think of me,
old boy, if I confess that in the excitement of the
game I’d forgotten about her coming?”</p>

<p>Joe grinned.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have been so quick to forget if
Clara had been able to come along with her,” he
said, as he walked along gingerly, favoring his
injured leg.</p>

<p>“Say, Joe, that leg must be pretty bad,” said
Jim, anxiously. “Better rest a while, don’t you
think, before starting out?”</p>

<p>“I tell you I’ve waited too long already,” returned
Joe. “Just call a taxi, will you? and we’ll
spin down to the hotel in no time.”</p>

<p>Jim went personally in search of a conveyance.
It was not hard to find one, and he returned
almost immediately to find Joe limping toward
him with the aid of a cane furnished by Dougherty.
The latter had offered him his shoulder,
but Joe, with a smile, refused.</p>

<p>“I may be a cripple, but I refuse to be treated
as such,” he told Jim, in response to the latter’s
protest. “Next thing you know, they’ll be offering
to carry me on a stretcher.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Jim noted that Joe sighted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
taxicab with eagerness, and leaned back in its
shabby interior with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“Hate to show myself to Mabel in this shape,”
he said ruefully. “Looks as though I’d had the
worst end of the fight.”</p>

<p>“Rather step up lively to the tune of ‘Hail the
Conquering Hero Comes,’ I suppose?” said Jim,
with an understanding grin. “I think I get your
train of thought all right, old man. But I
wouldn’t worry, if I were you. Nothing you
could do would ever make Mabel think you anything
but a hero.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope you have the right dope,” said
Joe.</p>

<p>He looked abstractedly from the dingy windows
of the cab at the spectacle of the crowded
streets. At that moment he really saw nothing
but his young wife as she had looked the last
time they had been forced to say good-bye. It
had seemed to him then that he could never bear
to part from her again. He was so eager to get
to her that he had a ludicrous desire to get out
and push the taxicab along.</p>

<p>“Thought it was to-night that Mabel was coming,”
remarked Jim, interrupting his reverie.
“You could have met her at the train then.”</p>

<p>“Reggie found that he would have to come
to the city on business, and since it was necessary
for him to come on an earlier train, Mabel decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to change her own plans so that she could
come along with him,” explained Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, so we’re about to see our old friend, Reggie,
again!” exclaimed Jim, with real enthusiasm.
“Glad to see the old boy, though I can’t
help wishing he’d mislay that monocle of his.
‘The bally thing makes me nervous, don’t you
know?’” he finished, in perfect imitation of the
absent Reggie.</p>

<p>Reginald Varley not only had the fact that he
was Mabel’s brother to recommend him to Joe
and Jim, but despite his affectation of a supposed
English accent and the absurdity of a monocle,
Reggie was a fine and likable fellow.</p>

<p>For his part, Reggie professed a great admiration
for the chums, especially for his brother-in-law,
Baseball Joe. When he could help it, he
never missed an opportunity of following the exploits
of the two, and, therefore, he had been
grateful on this occasion to business for furnishing
him an excuse for accompanying his sister to
Chicago while the Giants were still there.</p>

<p>“Suppose we go light on this accident, Jim,”
suggested Joe, indicating his injured leg and foot.
“Just a slight sprain you know.”</p>

<p>“I get you,” returned Jim, adding, as his suddenly
startled gaze leaped to the traffic that
whirled past the rapidly moving taxicab: “Look
at that car coming toward us. On the wrong side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the street, too! That driver’s either drunk
or crazy!”</p>

<p>Instantly Joe took in the danger. A big automobile,
being driven at terrific speed, had rounded
the corner on two wheels and was charging down
upon them. It seemed that the driver of their
taxicab would be a superman if he should prove
able to avoid a terrible accident.</p>

<p>Jim had opened the door as though to jump,
but Joe called to him.</p>

<p>“Sit tight, Jim,” he gritted. “It’s the only
way.”</p>

<p>Lucky for them that the taxi man was keen
witted. He saw the only thing that was possible
to do in such an emergency, and did it without
hesitation.</p>

<p>With a wild bumping of wheels and screeching
of emergency brake, the car skidded up on the
sidewalk, slithered along for a few feet and came
to a standstill. The oncoming car had missed the
rear wheels of the taxicab by the fraction of an
inch!</p>

<p>Pedestrians, sensing the imminent peril, had
scattered wildly, and now returned vociferously
to view the curious spectacle of a taxicab planted
squarely in the middle of the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Joe’s relief at the narrow escape from disaster
changed immediately to impatience with the rapidly
gathering and gaping crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“More delay! Say, Jim, can’t we beat it out
of here?”</p>

<p>“Fine chance! Especially with your game
leg,” Jim retorted, adding with a chuckle: “Here
comes a cop. Watch him get rid of the crowd.”</p>

<p>“More likely to arrest us for disorderly conduct
and disturbing the peace,” said Joe, disconsolately.
“Fine husband Mabel will think she
has. She’ll think I’m mighty anxious to get to
her.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be such a gloom hound,” laughed Jim.
“This cop has a pleasant face. Wait till I give
him some blarney.”</p>

<p>At that moment the policeman, having interviewed
the sullen and angry chauffeur, opened the
door of the cab. The constantly gathering crowd
pressed forward curiously to get a glimpse of Joe
and Jim.</p>

<p>The officer, a round-faced, good-natured-looking
individual, stared at Joe for a moment and
then broke into a broad grin.</p>

<p>“Begorry, if you ain’t the livin’ image of Baseball
Joe, the greatest slinger in captivity, my
name ain’t Denny M’Lean!”</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s Baseball Joe! And we owe the fact
that he’s still living to the quick wits of our friend
here,” broke in Jim, indicating the still furious
chauffeur. “That fool in the other car was driving
on the wrong side of the road, officer&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure he was!”</p>

<p>“I saw it myself!”</p>

<p>“Looked like a head-on collision, I’ll tell the
world!”</p>

<p>These and other cries came from the crowd,
among whom the news that the great Baseball
Joe occupied the cab with another famous twirler
had spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>“Do me a favor, will you, officer?” urged Joe,
taking out his watch and glancing at it hastily.
“I’m already late for an appointment. Clear the
road, will you, and let us get going?”</p>

<p>“So far as I see, there ain’t no particular objection
to that,” returned the bluecoat, with exasperating
deliberation. “The sidewalk ain’t no
proper parkin’ place for an automobile, as you
know. But as you seem to be havin’ plenty of
witnesses that say ye couldn’t have done no different,
’twill be easy to overlook yer imperdence.
Now thin,” turning to the crowd, “did any one
of ye notice the license plate of that law-breakin’
car?”</p>

<p>Several persons came forward with more or
less reliable information. After making a note
of this, while Joe fumed with increasing impatience,
the officer returned and grinned at them,
his eyes snapping with humor.</p>

<p>“Lucky for McRae of the Giants that Baseball
Joe kept a whole skin on him this day. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
get that truck driver I’ll be tellin’ him what I
think of him in no unsartin terms. Good-bye to
yez, and good luck.”</p>

<p>He thrust his huge paw inside the cab, and Joe
gripped it heartily. For many years after this
meeting with the great Giant twirler, Sergeant
Dennis M’Lean was to exhibit proudly the hand
that had been gripped by Baseball Joe.</p>

<p>They were off at last, crawling through the
close-packed crowd, and with tremendous relief
found themselves once more part of the traffic,
speeding toward the Wheatstone Hotel where
Mabel and Reggie were waiting for them.</p>

<p>“Suppose we’ll have a few blowouts now, just
to make the thing real good,” grumbled Joe, and
Jim laughed.</p>

<p>“Here we are before the Wheatstone now,” he
said. “Just goes to show how sound your gloomy
prophecies are!”</p>

<p>Joe’s heart leaped as he saw the great building
which he was making his headquarters during the
stay of the club in Chicago and where he had also
engaged a room for Reggie. He started to leap
from the cab, which had slowed at the curb, but
a sharp twinge from his injured leg reminded him
of his partly crippled condition.</p>

<p>“Take it easy, old man,” warned Jim. “If you
don’t favor that foot, you may find yourself laid
up for a month instead of a week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all very well for Jim to say “take it
easy,” but when a young married man has been
separated from his wife for weeks, the thing
isn’t so easily done.</p>

<p>They rode in the elevator to the fifth floor
where, leaning on his cane and refusing the help
of Jim’s arm, Joe got out and hobbled down the
corridor to the door of his apartment.</p>

<p>“Remember, I’m not really hurt, I just imagine
I am,” he cautioned Jim once more, as he put
his hand on the knob.</p>

<p>Instantly the door opened and a vision of
bright hair and rosy face seized him by the hand
and dragged him into the room.</p>

<p>“You too, Jim! Come in, do!” cried Mabel,
breathlessly. “Reggie and I have been waiting
ages for you. Joe&mdash;Joe, dear&mdash;that cane!
You&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing, nothing at all, little girl,” soothed
Joe, his arms about her. “Just a little spill on
the field. Be all right in a week. Ask Doc
Dougherty, if you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p>Mabel held him off anxiously at arm’s length
and looked appealingly at Jim.</p>

<p>“Is he telling me the truth? Is he?”</p>

<p>“Well, I like that!” said Joe, before Jim could
answer. “As if I didn’t always tell you the
truth?”</p>

<p>“You know, I never make it my business to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
interfere in the quarrels of husband and wife,”
drawled the familiar tones of Reggie, as, attracted
by the sound of voices, he strolled in from
the other room. “In fact, quarrels of any kind
are foreign to my gentle disposition, don’t you
know. But on this occasion, I really feel called
upon to interrupt. Jim, my dear fellow, how is
the old bean to-day? Rippin’, from the looks of
it, what? My word, brother-in-law,” turning to
Joe and adjusting his monocle so as to scrutinize
him the better, “you have been indulging in a
fisticuff of some sort, yes? Tried to do for the
old teammates, did you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, leave him alone, Reggie, do!” protested
Mabel, all tender solicitude, as she led Joe to a
chair and forced him into it. “Can’t you see he
is all tired out? Now don’t talk, dear, unless you
want to,” she added to Joe, placing a cushion behind
his head and looking at him anxiously, her
pretty head on one side.</p>

<p>Joe heaved a contented sigh and smiled up at
her.</p>

<p>“As long as you don’t tell me not to look at you,
I don’t care!” he said.</p>

<p>“My word, I do believe they have forgotten us
completely,” said Reggie, plaintively, as he placed
his monocle in his eye and stared at the absorbed
young couple. “Perhaps we had better be making
ourselves scarce, Jim, old chap.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” retorted Jim, moving a chair
up toward Joe and Mabel and placing himself in
it as though he intended remaining there indefinitely.
“I don’t stir a step from this place until
Mabel tells me all the news from home.”</p>

<p>“He means all the news about Clara,” laughed
Joe, as Mabel obediently sat down beside him
and turned her attention to Jim.</p>

<p>“Oh, Clara is all right,” said Mabel, but in
spite of her cheerful words, the others saw that
a cloud had darkened her face. “It is Mother
Matson I am worrying about,” she added slowly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Matson, Joe’s mother, had lately been in
poor health. Because of this fact, Mabel had
stayed with her mother-in-law for a time after her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
marriage to Joe. But recently she had yielded
to the urging of her own family to visit them in
Goldsboro, North Carolina, her old home. Although
Mabel had been busy renewing old friendships
there, she had kept in almost daily touch
with Mrs. Matson and Clara through the mails.
As a matter of fact, Jim had more than once complained
that Mabel heard a great deal more from
his fiancée than he did himself. Owing to the
constantly changing address of the team, Jim’s
mail, as well as Joe’s, was often delayed.</p>

<p>Because of Mrs. Matson’s illness, Clara had
postponed her marriage with Jim, hoping for her
mother’s restoration to health. Until that happy
time came, nothing remained to Jim but to possess
his soul in patience, which was often very
hard to do.</p>

<p>Now, at Mabel’s mention of his mother, Joe
started forward, fixing his anxious gaze upon his
wife.</p>

<p>“What has happened to mother?” he demanded.
“Is she&mdash;nothing serious, is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” said Mabel, patting his hand
soothingly. “There is nothing fatally wrong.
She is&mdash;oh, I might as well tell you at once, Joe
dear, for you would only worry the more if I
tried to keep things from you. It is feared that
Mother Matson must undergo an operation, a
rather serious operation, I am afraid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“What for?” asked Joe, quietly, although his
face had become suddenly white.</p>

<p>“Clara didn’t say in her letter,” returned Mabel,
soberly. “Your family doctor, Doctor
Reeves, is calling a consultation. Clara will undoubtedly
write more fully after that is over.”</p>

<p>“A consultation!” cried Joe, leaping to his feet,
only to slump down again in his chair at the pain
in his injured leg. “Why, this is horrible, girl!
Do you know when they expect to&mdash;do it?”</p>

<p>“They certainly won’t operate right away,
Clara says,” Mabel returned. “They think her
heart is too weak to stand the ordeal just now.
Dr. Reeves is going to put her through a special
course of treatment, and he thinks that in a month
or two she will be ready.”</p>

<p>“My poor mother!” groaned Joe. “How can
I go on playing ball with that thing in prospect?
I got a letter from mother a day or two ago,”
he added, feeling in the pocket of his coat for
the note from home. “She didn’t say anything
about any trouble then.”</p>

<p>“Of course she wouldn’t, you old silly,” said
Mabel, gently. “Don’t you know that mothers
always worry about everybody else but themselves?
Mother Matson never would take her
illness seriously, you know, and if she had she
would have been the very last one to worry you
with it. It was Clara, not your mother, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
decided you ought to be told now and asked me
to do it.”</p>

<p>“That sure is tough luck, Joe,” said Jim,
gravely. “I had no idea your mother was as
sick as that.”</p>

<p>“But, I say, don’t pull such a long face over it,
old chap,” urged Reggie, trying to strike a cheerful
note in the general gloom of the place.
“People are operated on, you know, some of them
again and again, and come up smilin’ in the end.
It’s a bally shame and all that, but no need giving
up hope altogether, you know. Hope on,
hope ever, as the poet sings. Now, I knew of a
person once who had a complication of diseases&mdash;most
distressin’&mdash;and the doctors insisted that
there must be an operation. But when the day
came for the operation, old chap, they
found&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Spare me the details, will you, Reggie?” urged
Joe. “I can’t go them just now.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, old chap, certainly,” agreed Reggie,
with swift compunction. “I might have
known the subject would be, well, distasteful to
you. To change the topic of conversation, just
cast your eye for a moment in the direction of
our old friend, Jim. He is dyin’ to learn more
about Clara, you know, and can’t for the life of
him decide how to tell you about it. How about
it, old chap? Am I right?” Saying this, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
tapped Jim playfully with his monocle, and the
latter reluctantly smiled.</p>

<p>“You sure are a mind reader, old boy,” he
said. “I must confess that a little first-hand news
of Clara would be welcome, and Mabel’s seen her
since I have.”</p>

<p>Joe, looking at Mabel at that moment, was
again surprised to find her eyes shadowed and
anxious. The expression passed in a moment,
however, and she smiled upon Jim reassuringly.</p>

<p>“Clara was dreadfully disappointed at not being
able to be here with Reggie and me, and of
course she is worried to death about Mother
Matson, but aside from that she’s all right.”</p>

<p>“No news of any kind?” urged Jim, regarding
Mabel closely. It seemed to Joe that Jim also
had noticed the faint hesitation that had crept
into Mabel’s manner at mention of Clara’s name.
“Even the smallest scrap of news, first hand,
would be mighty welcome, you know.”</p>

<p>Mabel seemed to hesitate, then got to her feet
and walked over to the window. The boys
watched her uneasily, but when she turned back
to them her face was bright and untroubled.</p>

<p>“I wish I had some news, Jim,” she said, in
her normal tone. “But you must remember that
I have been in Goldsboro for some time, and the
only news I get of Clara is through the mails.
But now I think I’ve been answering questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
enough,” she added lightly, a hand on Joe’s shoulder.
“I think I will start asking a few in my
turn. First of all, I want to know just how you
happened to get hurt, Joe.”</p>

<p>Despite the fact that, just then, he wished to
talk about nothing so little as about himself,
Joe recounted as quickly as he could the details
of his accident. From that the conversation
turned to the condition of the team and the discouraging
slump it had taken.</p>

<p>“We sure seem to be headed straight for the
bottom,” remarked Jim, adding, as he looked
ruefully at Joe: “And now with our champion
twirler laid up for an indefinite period, things
look pretty tough for the Giants. If only Jackwell
and Bowen would quit looking over their
shoulders and watch the ball, we might have a
chance to rattle the jinx that’s after us.”</p>

<p>Both Mabel and Reggie&mdash;the latter was an ardent
baseball fan and fairly “ate up” anything
that concerned the game&mdash;demanded to know
more about Jackwell and Bowen, and there ensued
an animated discussion as to the meaning of
the peculiar actions of the two men.</p>

<p>It was Reggie who finally repeated his suggestion
that he and Jim “toddle on” in order to leave
Joe and Mabel a few minutes of private conversation
before joining them again for dinner.</p>

<p>Joe did not protest very hard, for he was aching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to have Mabel to himself. He was very anxious
about his mother, and more than a little
curious to know what, if anything, was amiss
with Clara.</p>

<p>Mabel came to him herself as soon as the door
was closed behind Jim and Reggie. She held out
her hands to him and Joe took them gently.</p>

<p>“What is it, little girl?” he asked. “You were
holding back something about mother and Clara.
Now suppose you tell me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, I am so worried. I’ve told you
everything about poor mother. But Clara&mdash;well,
I think she ought to be soundly scolded!”</p>

<p>For the first time since he had heard of his
mother’s illness, Joe’s grave face relaxed in a
smile.</p>

<p>“Who’s going to do it&mdash;you?” he chaffed.
“You never scolded me but once, and then I liked
it.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t take me seriously, and this
really is serious, Joe,” said Mabel, her pretty
forehead marred by an anxious frown. “If you
could see this fellow with his handsome eyes and
his beautiful clothes&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What fellow?” interrupted Joe, becoming
suddenly interested. “You don’t mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes I do, just that!” returned Mabel, shaking
her head solemnly. “This Adonis I’m talking
about is pestering Clara with his attentions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give me his name,” cried Joe. “I’ll soon show
this little cupid where he gets off&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He isn’t little, Joe. He’s broad-shouldered
and six feet tall and he has a million dollars&mdash;maybe
ten million for all I know&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” roared Joe again, with
undiminished ire. “What do I care if he’s
twenty feet tall and has a billion dollars? Hang
around my sister, will he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, Joe, hush!” cautioned Mabel, putting
a finger to his lips and looking apprehensively
toward the door. “Some one will be coming in
to see where the fire is.”</p>

<p>Joe took her hand gently away and looked at
her intently.</p>

<p>“What is there behind all this?” he asked
quietly. “Clara doesn’t encourage this fellow,
does she? She wouldn’t do that?”</p>

<p>Mabel looked troubled.</p>

<p>“I hope not, Joe. Oh, I hope not!” she said,
and for a moment there was silence while the two
studied the pattern of the rug upon the floor,
busy with troubled thoughts. It was Joe who
again broke the silence.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me his name yet,” he reminded
Mabel, quietly.</p>

<p>“His name is Tom Pepperil. He used to live
near Riverside, but he went away for a long time
and made a fortune. Now he has come back, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
according to Clara’s letters, is making desperate
love to her.”</p>

<p>“But she has no right to listen to him! She’s
Jim’s!”</p>

<p>Mabel glanced up at him swiftly and then down
at the pattern of the rug again.</p>

<p>“No,” she said. Then, after a long minute,
she came close to Joe and put her hand over his
again.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be dreadful,” she said, “if the
worst we fear should happen, and she should
give up good old Jim for that fellow, whose chief
recommendation is his money?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t bear to think of it,” groaned Joe.
“I’d rather lose every cent I have in the world
than have it happen. Tell me that you don’t
think it will ever come to that!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Joe,” said Mabel, sadly. “She’s
so tantalizingly vague. Perhaps it’s the strain
she’s under on account of mother that makes her
so different from her usual self. I can’t understand
Clara any more.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence, and then Joe roused
himself to ask dully:</p>

<p>“Do you think we ought to tell Jim?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>THE HIDDEN-BALL TRICK</small></h2>


<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t tell Jim!” exclaimed Mabel, in
alarm. “In the first place, we’re not clear enough
about what Clara means to do. Perhaps it won’t
amount to anything after all. And if it does,
it’ll be bad enough when it comes without our
doing anything to hasten it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” said Joe, gloomily.
“There never seemed to be two people more perfectly
made for each other than Jim and Clara&mdash;always
excepting ourselves,” he hastened to add,
as he pressed her hand&mdash;“and it will be one of
the greatest blows of my life if there should be
any break between them. Clara seemed to be dead
in love with Jim; and as for him, he fairly worships
the ground she walks on. When he gets one
of her letters, he’s dead to the world. And he’s
one of the finest fellows that ever breathed. I
look on him as a brother. He hasn’t any bad habits,
is as straight as a string, a splendid specimen
of manhood, handsome, well educated&mdash;what on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
earth could any girl ask for more? And he’s
making a splendid income too. Has Clara suddenly
gone crazy?”</p>

<p>“It’s beyond me,” replied Mabel. “Clara is
the dearest girl, but just now I’d like to give her
a good shaking. Lots of girls of course are dazzled
by millions, but I never believed Clara would
be one of them. And perhaps she isn’t, Joe dear.
We may be doing her a great injustice. We’ll
have to wait and see.”</p>

<p>“Well, promise me, anyway, that you’ll write
to her at once,” urged Joe. “I’d do it myself, but
you girls can talk to each other about such things
a good deal better than any man can. Try to
bring her to her senses and urge her not to wreck
her own life and Jim’s simply for money or social
position. She’d only be gaining the shadow of
happiness and losing the substance.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write to-morrow,” promised Mabel. “But
now let’s dismiss all unpleasant thoughts and remember
only that we’re together.”</p>

<p>While Joe was desperate at the injury to his
foot that kept him out of the game just at a time
he was sorely needed by his team, he found some
compensation in the fact that he could spend
more time with Mabel than would otherwise have
been possible. He did not have to take part in
the morning practice, and in the afternoons he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and Mabel attended the games together as spectators.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mabel was deeply disappointed
that she could not see Joe pitch, as she
had joyously counted on doing. She was intensely
proud of her famous young husband, and was always
one of the most enthusiastic rooters when
he was scheduled to take his turn in the box.
More than once Joe had won some critical game
because of the inspiration that came to him from
the knowledge that Mabel was looking on. But
there was no use murmuring against fate, and
they had to take things as they were, promising
themselves to make up for their disappointment
later in the season.</p>

<p>Reggie, too, felt that fate had treated him unfairly.</p>

<p>“Why, to tell the bally truth, old topper,” he
declaimed to Joe, “I didn’t have to come to Chicago
at all, don’t you know! I just drummed up
the excuse that I ought to look over our branch
in this city, and the guv’nor fell for it. It’s rippin’,
simply rippin’, the way you’ve been pitchin’
and battin’ ever since the season opened, and I’d
been countin’ on seem’ you stand the blighters
on their heads. And just when I got here, the
old leg had to go bad! It’s disgustin’!”</p>

<p>“Hard luck, old boy,” laughed Joe. “But
you’ll see many a game yet through that blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
monocle of yours. If you feel sore, think how
much sorer I am and take comfort.”</p>

<p>The crowning disgrace of having the Cubs take
four games in a row was happily spared the
Giants. McRae put in Jim again, and this time
the team gave him better support and he pulled
out a victory.</p>

<p>“Great stuff, old man,” congratulated Joe, as
Jim, after the game, came up to the box in which
Joe and Mabel were sitting.</p>

<p>“You pitched beautifully, Jim,” was Mabel’s
tribute, as she smiled upon him.</p>

<p>“Awfully nice of you to say so,” responded
Jim, in a sort of lifeless way. “But most of the
credit was due to the team. They played good
ball to-day. Guess I’ll go and dress now and
see you later.”</p>

<p>Joe and Mabel looked at each other, as Jim
stalked away across the diamond to the clubhouse.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t seem very responsive, does he?” remarked
Mabel.</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t,” said Joe thoughtfully. “Generally
he’s bubbling over with enthusiasm after
the Giants have won. He’s been very quiet since
our talk last night.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he suspected there was anything
wrong?” asked Mabel, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” answered Joe somberly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
“He’s quick as a flash to sense anything, and I
noticed a shadow on his face as he watched you
when we were talking about Clara. Hang it all!”
he burst out, with a vehemence that startled Mabel.
“If Clara throws him down, I’ll never forgive
her, even if she is my sister. What’s the
matter with the girls nowadays, anyway? Haven’t
they any sense?”</p>

<p>“Some of them have,” answered Mabel. “Myself,
for instance. That’s the reason I married
you, Joe dear.”</p>

<p>“For which heaven be thanked,” responded Joe,
with a fervor that left nothing for Mabel to desire.
“I’m the luckiest fellow on earth. And
just because I am so happy, I want Jim to be
happy too.</p>

<p>“Then, there’s another thing,” he went on,
“which, while it’s infinitely less important than
Jim’s happiness, is important, just the same.
That is the effect it will have on the chances of
the Giants. We never needed men to be in shape
to do their best work as much as we need them
now. And the most important men on any team
are the pitchers. I’m not saying that because I’m
a pitcher, but because it’s a simple fact that every
one knows. Let the pitchers go wrong, and the
best team on earth can’t win. And a pitcher that
has a load of trouble on his mind can’t do his best
work. How do you suppose Jim can keep up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
his standard if Clara does her best to break his
heart?”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s true,” assented Mabel. “And
yet I thought he pitched well to-day.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know all we know,” replied Joe.
“He just has a suspicion, and he’s trying to assure
himself that it’s groundless. But even at
that, he wasn’t in his usual form this afternoon.
You may not have noticed it, but I did. He got
by because the boys played well behind him and
because the Cubs let down and played indifferent
ball. But he wasn’t the old Jim. Already
that thing is beginning to work on him. And if
the worst happens, it will break him all up&mdash;at
least, for the present season. If I had that sister
of mine here this afternoon, I’ll bet she’d hear
something that would make her ears burn.”</p>

<p>Mabel soothed him as best she could, but her
own heart was heavy as she thought of the possibilities
that the future held in store for poor Jim.</p>

<p>From Chicago the Giants went to St. Louis,
the last stop on their Western schedule. Here
they had some hopes of redeeming themselves
and making up for their recent failures, for the
Cardinals were going none too well. Mornsby,
their famous shortstop, had had a quarrel with
the manager, and was seeking to get his release
to some other team, any one of which would have
snapped him up at a fabulous price. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
rumors of cliques in the team, and their prospects
for the season were none too flattering.</p>

<p>But no matter how poorly a team had been
going, they always seemed to brace up when they
were to meet the Giants. They reserved their
best pitchers for those games, and the fans came
out in droves in order to see the proud team of
the Metropolis humbled.</p>

<p>So the clean sweep that the Giants had been
hoping for did not materialize. Markwith, to be
sure, carried off the first game by a comfortable
margin. He was one of the pitchers who when
he was good was very good indeed, and on that
day his southpaw slants were simply unhittable.</p>

<p>But the St. Louis evened things up the next day
by beating Bradley, one of the Giants’ second
string pitchers, by a score of eight to five. On
the following day, the pendulum swung again to
the other side of the arc, and Jim chalked up a
victory, despite some pretty free hitting by the
home team.</p>

<p>The Giants pinned their hopes once again to
Markwith in the last game of the series. He
was not so good as on the opening day, but even
then he might have won, had it not been for a
stupid play by Iredell in the ninth inning.</p>

<p>One man was out in the Giants’ last half. The
score was seven to six in favor of St. Louis.
Iredell had reached first on a single, and on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
wild pitch had advanced to second. Burkett,
the heavy hitting first baseman, was at the bat.
A hit would probably bring Iredell in and tie the
score.</p>

<p>Iredell was taking a pretty long lead off second
and “Red” Smith, the Cardinal catcher, shot the
ball down to second, hoping to catch him napping.
Iredell, however, made a quick slide back
to the bag and got there before Salberg, the Cardinal
second baseman, could put the ball on him.</p>

<p>Iredell got up, grinned triumphantly at Salberg,
dusted off his clothes, and again took a lead
off the bag. Quick as a flash, Salberg, who had
concealed the ball under his arm, ran up to
Iredell and touched him out.</p>

<p>A groan of distress came from the Giants and
their supporters and a roar of derision from the
St. Louis crowd. That a big-league player could
be caught by a trick that was as old as the hills
seemed almost incredible. It was years since
the moth-eaten play had been seen on a major-league
diamond, and the crowd yelled itself
hoarse.</p>

<p>Iredell stood for a moment as if stupefied, then
he walked slowly into the bench, his face a flaming
red. If McRae forebore to tell him what
he thought of him, it was because he was so
choked that the words would not come. But
the glare that he turned on the luckless player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was more eloquent than any words, even in his
rich vocabulary.</p>

<p>Joe turned to Mabel, where he was sitting beside
her in the stands immediately back of the
pitcher.</p>

<p>“Did you see that?” he asked. “To think of
a Giant player being caught by a sand-lot trick!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t quite get it,” answered Mabel. “I
was looking at the batter at the time. Just what
was it that happened?”</p>

<p>“Salberg hid the ball under his arm instead
of throwing it back to the pitcher,” explained
Joe. “Iredell took it for granted that he had
thrown it, and was so busy dusting off his clothes
that he didn’t make sure of it. Why, Shem tried
that on Japhet when they came out of the ark.
And to think that he chose this moment to pull
that bonehead play! Look at that hit by Burkett.
It would have brought Iredell home with
the run which would have tied the score.”</p>

<p>Their eyes followed the flight of the ball, which
was a mighty three-bagger that Burkett had lined
out between right and center. It brought a rousing
cheer from the Giant partisans, and hope revived
that the game might yet be saved. But the
hope was vain, for the fly that Wheeler sent out
into the field settled firmly in the leftfielder’s
hand, and the inning and the game were over, with
the St. Louis having the big end of the score.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a hard game to lose, and it was a disgruntled
lot of Giant players that filed off dejectedly
to their dressing rooms. A sure tie, at
least, had been within their grasp, and, as a matter
of fact, a probable victory. For if Iredell
had scored, as he could easily have done on the
three base hit of Burkett, the latter would have
been on third with only one man out instead of
two and with the score tied. Then Wheeler’s
long hit, even though an out, would have gone
for a sacrifice and Burkett could easily have
scored from third, putting the Giants one run
ahead. To be sure, the St. Louis would still
have had the last half of the ninth, but the Giants,
fighting to hold their advantage, would have had
all the odds in their favor.</p>

<p>But all the post mortems in the world could
not change the fact that the game had gone into
the St. Louis column and that the Giants, instead
of taking three out of four, had had to be content
with an even break. It was small consolation
that that was better than they had been able
to do with the other Western teams. The trip
had been a terrible flivver, one of the worst that
the Giant team had ever made while swinging
around the circle.</p>

<p>“That’s the last straw that breaks the camel’s
back,” growled McRae, savagely. “It’ll make us
the laughing stock of the League. Why, at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
minute, the crowds before the bulletin boards all
over the United States are snickering at the
Giants. Not merely a Giant player&mdash;that would
be bad enough&mdash;but the Giant captain&mdash;get me?&mdash;the
Giant captain, supposed to show his men
how the game should be played, gets caught by
the oldest and cheapest trick in the game. It’s
all we needed to wind up this trip. I want to go
away somewhere and hide my head. I hate to
go back and face the grins of the New York fans.”</p>

<p>“It sure is tough,” agreed Robbie. “Of course
that finishes Iredell as captain.”</p>

<p>“That goes without saying,” replied McRae.
“Even if I were disposed to overlook it and give
him another chance, I couldn’t do it now. When
a captain, instead of being respected by his men,
becomes the butt of the team and a joke to the
fans all over the circuit, he’s through.”</p>

<p>A little later the stocky manager sought out
Iredell and found him alone.</p>

<p>“I know what you want to see me about,”
Iredell forestalled him. “You want my resignation
as captain of the team. Well, here it is,”
and he handed over a paper.</p>

<p>“All right, Iredell,” returned McRae, after
he had scanned the paper carefully and stowed it
away in his pocket. “I’ll accept this, and I won’t
say anything more about that play, because I
know how sore you’re feeling and I don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to rub it in. I’ll admit that at the time it happened,
I saw red. But what’s past is past, and
there’s no use crying about spilled milk.”</p>

<p>“You can have my resignation as shortstop too,
if you want it,” growled Iredell, who was evidently
in a nasty humor.</p>

<p>“I don’t want it,” said McRae, kindly.
“You’re a good shortstop, and I’ve no fault to
find with your work as such. And now that you’ve
got nothing to think about except playing your
position, I hope you’ll do better than ever. One
thing I’m counting on, too, is that you cherish no
grudges and give full loyalty to the man I’m going
to make captain. Is that a go?”</p>

<p>Iredell grunted something that McRae chose
to accept as an affirmative. But he would have
changed his opinion if he had seen the ugly glare
in Iredell’s eyes and the clenched fist that Iredell
shook at the manager’s back as the latter walked
away.</p>

<p>“Give me a dirty deal and expect me to take it
lying down, do you?” he snarled. “You’ve got
another guess coming, and don’t you forget it!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE NEW CAPTAIN</small></h2>


<p>Although Iredell had himself offered his resignation,
he had only done it to take the wind out
of McRae’s sails and put himself in a better strategic
position. If worst came to worst, he could
save his pride by saying that he had resigned of
his own accord instead of being “fired.”</p>

<p>But he had hoped, nevertheless, that the resignation
would be refused and that McRae, after
perhaps giving him a lecture, would accord him
another chance. The prompt acceptance had
caught him off his balance, and he was full of
rage at the conviction that McRae had sought
him out for the express purpose of displacing
him.</p>

<p>As Robbie had previously intimated, Iredell
was a poor sport. The events of the last few
days should have taught him that the duties of
captain were too much for him. But like many
other people, he was inclined to blame everything
and everybody else for his own shortcomings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
He had been intensely vain of his position as captain
of the team. His nature was, at bottom,
petty and vindictive, and from the moment it
dawned upon him what had happened to him, he
framed a resolution to do all that lay in his power
to thwart the plans of his successor. If he had
failed, he would try to prove that whoever took
his place could do no better.</p>

<p>With his resentment was mingled curiosity as
to the man that was to succeed him. Who could
it be? He ran over in his mind the other members
of the outfield and infield, never once thinking
of the pitchers, who were assumed to be out
of the question. The more he pondered, the more
puzzled he became. Well, after all, it did not
matter. He would know soon enough. And whoever
it was would find his work mighty hard for
him, as far as he, Iredell, could make it so.</p>

<p>That night the Giants shook the dust of St.
Louis from their feet, and with a sigh of relief,
not unmingled with apprehension, took the train
for the long jump home. Relief that the disastrous
Western trip was at last over. Apprehension
at the reception they would meet from
the newspapers and fans of New York.</p>

<p>Mabel was to accompany Joe back to New
York and remain there for about two weeks
before she returned for a while to Goldsboro.
Joe looked forward to these as golden days, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the outlook went far to console him for his chagrin
at the Giants’ poor showing.</p>

<p>His leg and foot were mending rapidly, and
he hoped to be in form again almost as soon as
he reached New York and to be able to go in and
take his regular turn in the box. And if ever the
Giants needed his pitching and batting strength,
it was now!</p>

<p>He and Mabel had just returned from the dining
car to the Pullman that first evening on the
train that was bearing them East, when McRae
and Robbie came along.</p>

<p>They knew Mabel well, because, on the trip of
the Giants around the world, she had gone along
with Mrs. McRae and other married women as
chaperons.</p>

<p>“Blooming as a rose,” said Robbie, gallantly.
“When it comes to picking, we have to hand it
to Joe.”</p>

<p>“Still as full of blarney as ever,” laughed
Mabel. “I suppose you say that to every girl
you meet.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, not-at-all!” disclaimed Robbie, his
round face beaming.</p>

<p>“King of Northern pitchers and queen of
Southern women,” put in McRae. “It’s a winning
combination.”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit the part about the women,” agreed
Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I’ll admit the part about the pitchers,”
said Mabel, her smile enhanced by a bewitching
dimple.</p>

<p>“Then we’re all happy,” laughed McRae.
“But now I’m going to ask the queen to let the
king come along with Robbie and me into the
smoking car for a while. I’ve got a little business
to talk over.”</p>

<p>“Hold on to me, Mabel,” cried Joe, in mock
alarm. “Mac wants to fire me, but he won’t do
it as long as I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“I’m not very much worried,” responded Mabel,
merrily. “For that matter, I shouldn’t wonder
if you were honing to get rid of me. Go
along now, and I’ll console myself with a magazine
until you get back.”</p>

<p>The three men went into the smoking car and
settled themselves comfortably. Then when the
two older men had lighted cigars, McRae hurled
a question.</p>

<p>“Joe, how would you like to be captain of the
Giants?” he asked.</p>

<p>Joe was completely taken aback for a moment.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! You sure do hit a fellow right
between the eyes, Mac,” he responded. “Just
what do you mean? You’ve got a captain now,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I had an apology for a captain up to this afternoon,”
was the reply. “But I haven’t even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that now. Here, read this,” and he thrust Iredell’s
written resignation into his hand.</p>

<p>Joe read it with minute attention.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for Iredell,” he remarked, as he
refolded the paper and handed it back. “But I
won’t pretend that I’m surprised. But what
strikes me all in a heap is your question to me.
Remember that I’m a pitcher. As my brother-in-law,
Reggie, would remark, ‘it simply isn’t
done.’”</p>

<p>“You’re a pitcher, all right,” responded McRae,
“and the best that comes. But you’re more
than that. You’re a thinker. And that’s the
kind of man I’ve got to have for captain. There’s
no other man on the team that fills the bill.
They’d rattle around in the position like a pea in
a tincup. You’d fill it to perfection. That’s the
reason I offer it to you. You know, of course,
that it means an increase in your salary, but I
know that isn’t the thing that would especially
appeal to you. I want you to take the position
because I think it will be the best thing for the
Giants. Think it over.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a few minutes while Joe
thought it over and thought hard. He knew that
it would mean an immense addition to his work
and his responsibilities. He would have to play
every day, while now he played, at the most, only
twice a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Without self-conceit, he knew that he could
qualify for the position. Again and again he had
groaned inwardly at baseball sins of omission
and commission that he felt sure would not have
occurred had he had the deciding voice on the
field.</p>

<p>It finally simmered down to this: Would it
help the Giants? Would it increase their chances
for the pennant? He decided that it would.
And the moment he reached that conclusion his
answer was ready.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it, Mac,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Bully!” exclaimed McRae, as he reached over
and shook Joe’s hand to bind the bargain. “Don’t
think for a minute, Joe, that I don’t appreciate
the immense amount of work that this will put
upon you. I don’t want to ride a willing horse
to death.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Mac,” answered Joe. “The
only possible doubt in my mind was as to whether
it might affect my pitching or hitting. I wouldn’t
want to let down in those things. But if you’re
willing to take a chance, I am.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take all the chances and all the responsibility,”
replied McRae, confidently. “I haven’t
watched you all these years for nothing. I’ve
never asked you to do anything yet that you
haven’t done to the queen’s taste. You’ve developed
into the best pitcher in the game. You’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
developed into the best batter in the game. Now
I look for you to develop into the best captain in
the game.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet dollars to doughnuts that he will,”
broke in Robbie, his rubicund face aglow with satisfaction.
“Now we’ll begin to see the Giants
climb.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure they will,” affirmed McRae. “We’ve
added fifty per cent. to the Giants’ strength by
this night’s work. You know as well as I do,
Joe, that the class is there. All it needs is to be
brought out. And you’re the boy that’s going to
do it. Put your fighting spirit into them. I was
going to say put your brains into them, but that
couldn’t be done without a surgical operation. But
you can teach them to use the brains they have,
and that itself will go a long way.”</p>

<p>“How did Iredell take it when you saw him?”
asked Joe, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course he was sore,” answered McRae.
“But how much of that was due to his soreness
over that bonehead play, and how much to the
fact that I accepted his resignation so promptly,
I can’t say. But I don’t think you’ll have any
trouble with him.”</p>

<p>Joe, who knew Iredell’s nature a good deal better
than McRae, was not at all sure, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p>“As for the other members of the team,” went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
on McRae, “they all think you’re about the best
that ever happened, and I’m sure they’ll be delighted
with the change. You’ll find them backing
you up to the limit. The rookies, too, look
up to you as a kingpin pitcher and batter, and
they’ll be just clay in your hands. You can do
with them whatever you will. We’ve picked up
some promising material there, and you’re the one
to bring out all that’s in them.”</p>

<p>“You can depend on me to do my best,” Joe
responded warmly.</p>

<p>“That means that we’ll win the flag even with
our bad beginning,” declared McRae. “And now
just one other thing, Joe. I want you to feel
perfectly free to discuss with Robbie and me anything
you think will be for the best interests of
the team. If you think any man ought to be fired,
tell me so. If you think of any player we can
go out and get, tell me that, too. We’ll welcome
any suggestions. Have you anything of
that kind now in mind? If so, let’s have it.”</p>

<p>“I certainly don’t want any one fired,” said
Joe, with a smile. “At least, not for the present.
As to getting any new players, I saw something
in the evening papers a half an hour ago that set
me thinking. Have you seen that the Yankees
have determined to let Hays go?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t,” replied McRae with quickened
interest. “I haven’t looked at to-night’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
papers. But after all that won’t do us any good.
Some other club in the American League will
snap him up.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I should have thought,” answered
Joe. “But the surprising thing is that all
the other clubs in the American have waived
claims upon him. That leaves us free to make an
offer for him, if we want him.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” mused McRae. “Remember
the way he played against us in the World Series?
He had us nailed to the mast and crying
for help.”</p>

<p>“He sure did,” agreed Robbie. “But he hasn’t
been going very well since then. Rather hard to
manage in the first place, and then, too, he seems
to be losing his effectiveness. If no other club
in the American League wants him, he must be
nearly through.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it struck me at first when I
read the telegram,” said Joe. “Then I got to
thinking it over. Why don’t the other clubs in
the American League want him?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bite,” said McRae. “What’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s this,” suggested Joe. “Hays, as
you know, has that peculiar cross-fire delivery
that singles him out among pitchers. No other
pitcher in either League has one just like it. It
isn’t that it’s so very effective when you come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
know it. But because it’s so unlike any other,
it puzzles all teams until they get used to it.
That’s the way it was with us in the Series. The
first two games we couldn’t do a thing to him.
In the third we were beginning to bat him more
freely.</p>

<p>“Now, what does that lead up to? Just this.
The other teams in the American League have
become so used to his pitching that it’s lost its
terrors. If any one of them bought him from
the Yankees, they’d have to stack him up against
the seven other teams in their League who have
learned to bat him without trouble.</p>

<p>“But with the National League it’s different.
It would take them considerable time to get on
to him. In the meantime, he might have won
two or three games from each of them before they
solved him. He might be good for fifteen or
twenty victories before this season is over. He
might&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By ginger!” interrupted McRae. “Joe, that
think tank of yours is working day and night.
I’ll get in touch with the Yankee management
by wire at the next station.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>GETTING IN SHAPE</small></h2>


<p>“There’s something right off the bat for a
starter,” exulted Robbie. “Now, how about the
rest of the team?”</p>

<p>“I think they’re just about as good as they
come,” remarked Joe. “Jackwell and Bowen
are a big improvement on Hupft and McCarney
both in fielding and batting. Burkett is digging
them out of the dirt at first all right, and Larry
takes everything that comes into his territory.
Our outfield is one of the heaviest hitting in the
League&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And it will hit harder yet when you’re playing
out there the days you’re not in the box,”
chuckled Robbie. “They’ll have to move back
the fences in the ball parks for your homers.
You’ll break up many a game with that old wagon
spoke of yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the days I play in the outfield, one of the
men will have to be benched,” mused Joe. “Which
one shall it be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll let that depend on the way they keep
up with the stick,” said McRae. “That will be
a spur to them. Neither Curry nor Wheeler
nor Bowen will want to sit on the bench, and
they’ll work their heads off to keep on the batting
order. There again it will be a good thing for
the team. Every man will be fighting to make
the best showing possible.”</p>

<p>“Talking about Jackwell and Bowen,” remarked
Robbie. “Have you ever noticed anything
queer about those birds?”</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to be as husky as they might
be,” observed McRae. “Just the other day they
begged to be let off because they said they were
sick. Over eating, perhaps. That’s a common
fault with young players when they first come into
the big League and eat at the swell hotels.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that I meant,” explained Robbie.
“They seem to be nervous and jumpy. Looking
around as though they expected every minute to
feel somebody’s hand on their shoulder.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed that,” said Joe. “It was only
the other day I was speaking to Jim about it.
Probably it will wear off when they get a little
better used to big-league company. I’ll have a
quiet little talk with them about it.”</p>

<p>For another hour they discussed matters bearing
on the welfare of the club, and then Joe went
back to Mabel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought you’d forgotten all about poor
little me,” she said, with an adorable pout of
her pretty lips.</p>

<p>Joe looked around to see that no one was observing
them, and straightened out the pout in a
manner perfectly satisfactory to both.</p>

<p>“Well, did McRae fire you, as you call it?”
asked Mabel.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” answered Joe, as he settled himself
beside her. “In fact, instead of kicking me downstairs
he kicked me up.”</p>

<p>“Meaning?” said Mabel, with a questioning
intonation.</p>

<p>“Meaning,” repeated Joe, “that he made me
captain of the Giant team.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Mabel, as though she
could not believe her ears.</p>

<p>“Just that,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, what an honor!” exclaimed Mabel,
with pride and delight. “I’m so proud! That’s
another proof of what they think of you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is an honor,” agreed Joe, “and
it will mean a nice little addition to my salary.
I’ll clean up over twenty thousand this year altogether.
And, if we get into the World Series,
there will be a few thousands more. But it means
a great addition of work and responsibility.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t overtax yourself, dear,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Mabel, anxiously. “Remember that your health
and strength are above everything.”</p>

<p>“If I felt any healthier or stronger than I am
now, I’d be afraid of myself,” replied Joe, grinning.
“Don’t worry, honey. All I care for is to
make good in my new job.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do that,” said Mabel, proudly, as she
patted his hand. “You’d make good in anything.
You’d make a good president of the United
States.”</p>

<p>“I’d be sure of one vote, anyhow, if I ran for
the presidency,” laughed Joe. “In fact, I’m
afraid they’d have you pinched for repeating.
You’d try to stuff the ballot boxes.”</p>

<p>The long journey ended at last, with all the
players glad to be back in what they fondly referred
to as “little old New York.” There was
no brass band to meet them at the station, nor
had the fans turned out in any great numbers,
as they did when the Giants returned from a triumphant
trip. It was an unusual experience for
the Giants, who had the reputation of a great
road team and commonly arrived with scalps at
their belt. At present, however, they were distinctly
out of favor. Nor did they derive any
comfort from the brief and sarcastic references
to their return in the columns of the city press.</p>

<p>Joe and Mabel took a taxicab to the hotel
where they usually made their headquarters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Reggie, to his regret, had not been able to accompany
them, though he promised to come on
later.</p>

<p>“Beastly shame,” he had said, in parting, “that
I could only see the Giants when they were coming
a cropper. But I’ll get to the big city soon
and see them get even with those rotters. My
word! It’s been simply disgustin’!”</p>

<p>The perfect rest during the journey had been
of immense benefit to Joe’s injured leg and foot,
and he was overjoyed to find that he was now as
fit as ever. The perfect physical condition in
which he kept himself had contributed toward a
quick recovery.</p>

<p>The relief and satisfaction of McRae and Robbie
over his condition were unbounded, for with
Joe out of the game the Giants were a different
and far inferior team.</p>

<p>Mabel had plenty of shopping and sightseeing
to keep her spare time employed through the day,
and at night she and Joe had a delightful time
taking in the best shows on Broadway.</p>

<p>The first morning that the team turned out
for practice on the Polo Grounds, Joe sought an
opportunity for a quiet talk with Iredell.</p>

<p>The fact that McRae had made a generous interpretation
of the clause in Iredell’s contract regarding
his salary as captain had not abated the
resentment of that individual. He had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
moody and grouchy ever since his displacement,
and had nursed his supposed grievance until his
heart was fairly festering with bitterness. He
was sore at McRae, but even more so at Joe, as
his successor. The latter, he persuaded himself,
had intrigued to get his place.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a talk with all the boys together,
Iredell,” Joe greeted him pleasantly, in
a secluded corner of the grounds. “But first I
wanted to see you personally. I just want to say
that we’ve always got along together all right,
that I value you as one of the best players on the
team, and that I hope our pleasant relations will
continue.”</p>

<p>But Iredell was in no mood to take the olive
branch that Joe held out to him.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’ll have to do what you tell me to,”
he muttered sourly. “You’re the boss now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like that word ‘boss,’” returned Joe.
“I don’t have any of the feeling that that word
implies. If I have to exercise the authority that
has been given me, it will be simply because that’s
my job, and not because I have a swelled head.
McRae’s the boss of all of us. You say you’ll
have to do what I tell you to. But I’m hoping
you’ll do your best, not because I tell you to, but
because you want to do whatever is for the best
interests of the team. How about it, Iredell?
Does that go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, what’s the use of talking about it,”
snapped Iredell. “I’ll do my work as shortstop.
You’ve got the job you’ve been working for.
Let it go at that.”</p>

<p>His tone was so offensive, to say nothing of the
implication of his words, that Joe had to make a
mighty effort to restrain his naturally quick temper.
But he knew that he could not rule others
unless he had first learned to master himself.
So that it was with no trace of anger that he replied:</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Iredell. I haven’t worked for
this job. I didn’t want it. I hadn’t even thought
of it. I was struck all in a heap when McRae
asked me to take it. And at that time, you’d already
resigned. That’s the absolute truth.”</p>

<p>Iredell made no answer, but his sniff of unbelief
spoke volumes. Joe saw that while he was
in this mood there was nothing to be gained by
talking longer.</p>

<p>“Think it over, old boy,” he said pleasantly.
“I’m your friend, and I want to stay your friend.
I know how well you can play, and I’m sure you’re
going to do your best with the rest of us to bring
the pennant once more to New York.”</p>

<p>He moved away, and a little later had gathered
the rest of the team in the clubhouse.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to do much talking, fellows,”
he said. “McRae has already told you that I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to be captain of the team. I’m proud to be captain
of such a bunch. I feel that all of us are
brothers. We’ve been comrades in many a hard
fight, and there are lots of such fights ahead of
us. But all our fighting will be done against the
other fellows and not among ourselves. I’m
counting on every one of you to go in and work
his head off for the good of the team. That must
be the only thing that counts with any of us.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to exercise a single bit of authority
that I don’t have to. But I’m not going to
fall down on my job if I can help it. If I have
to call a man down, I’ll call him down. While
we’re out on the field, what I say will have to go.
You may think it’s right or you may think it’s
rotten, but all the same it will have to go. But
you’ll understand that there’s nothing personal
and that whatever’s done is for the good of the
team. You know I’d rather boost than roast,
and that I’ll praise a good play just as readily
as I’d blame a bad one. Now how about it, fellows?
Are you with me?”</p>

<p>“We’re wid ye till the cows come home!”
shouted Larry, enthusiastically. “Three cheers
for the new captain!”</p>

<p>Rousing cheers shook the clubhouse and sealed
the compact.</p>

<p>Then, with a new spirit, the Giants plunged
into the pennant fight. It was a hard fight that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lay before them, and none of them underrated
it. But the grim determination that had been in
evidence many times previously was now again
to the fore, and it boded ill for their rivals.</p>

<p>Mabel, after a tender parting, had returned for
a brief while to Goldsboro, and Joe concentrated
all the energies of brain and body on his new task.
Like the war horse, he “sniffed the battle from
afar,” and was eager to plunge into the thick of
the fray. Would he emerge the winner?</p>

<p>Baseball Joe, for the time being, gave no more
attention to Iredell’s grouchiness. He knew the
player felt sore, but never realized how far that
soreness might carry the fellow.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix him some day, see if I don’t,” muttered
Iredell to himself when on his way to the hotel
that night. “I’ll fix him. Just wait and see!
I’ll teach him to ride over me!”</p>

<small>WINGING THEM OVER</small></h2>


<p>“So ’tis your birthday, I do be hearin’, Joe,”
remarked Larry Barrett, the jovial second baseman
of the team, as the Giants were getting into
their uniforms preparatory to going out on the
field.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” laughed Joe, as he finished tying
his shoe laces.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you were a ball player from the cradle,”
grinned Larry.</p>

<p>“I guess I bawled all right,” Joe replied. “And
once, my mother tells me, I pitched headlong from
my baby carriage.”</p>

<p>“What would you like for a birthday present?”
queried Wheeler.</p>

<p>“Ten runs,” replied Joe, promptly. “Give me
those to-day and I won’t ask for anything else.”</p>

<p>“Pretty big order,” remarked Wheeler, dubiously.
“Ten runs are a lot to make against those
Brooklyn birds. I hear they’re going to put in
Dizzy Rance to-day, and he’s a lulu. Won his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
last eight games and has started in to make a
record. Have a heart, Joe, and make it five.”</p>

<p>“Five’s plenty,” asserted Jim, confidently. “I’m
willing to bet that’s more than the Dodgers will
get, with Joe in the box.”</p>

<p>“We’ll know more about that when the game’s
over,” said Joe, as he moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“Gee! Look at those stands and bleachers,”
remarked Jim, as he and his chum came out on
the field. “Seems as though all New York and
Brooklyn had turned out. And it’s nearly an hour
before the game begins. They’ll be turning them
away from the gates.”</p>

<p>“Almost like a World Series crowd,” agreed
Joe, as they made their way across the green velvet
turf of the outfield toward the Giants’ dugout.</p>

<p>It was a phenomenal throng for that stage of
the playing season, and was accounted for by the
traditional rivalry between the two teams, which,
while hailing from different boroughs, were both
included within the limits of Greater New York.
They fought each other like Kilkenny cats whenever
they came together. No matter how indifferently
they might have been going with other
teams, they always braced when they had each
other as opponents. It was not an uncommon
thing, even in the seasons when the Giants had
taken the series from every other team in the
League, to lose the majority of the games with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the Brooklyns, even though the latter might be
tagging along in the rear of the second division.</p>

<p>But this year the Brooklyns were going strong,
and it was generally admitted that they had a
look-in for the pennant. Several trades during
the previous winter had strengthened the weak
places in the line-up, and their pitching staff was
recognized as one of the best in either League.</p>

<p>“Going to pick the feathers off those birds to-day,
Joe?” asked McRae, as Joe came up to the
Giants’ bench, where the manager was sitting.</p>

<p>“I sure am going to try,” replied Joe. “It’s
about time we put a crimp in their winning streak.”</p>

<p>Joe beckoned to Mylert, and they went out to
warm up. He was feeling in excellent fettle, and
he soon found that he had all his “stuff” with him.
His curve had a sharp break, his slow ball floated
up so that it seemed to be drifting, and his fast
ones whizzed over like a bullet.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the goods to-day, Joe,” pronounced
Mylert, and he fairly winced at the way the ball
shot into his hands. “You’ve got speed to burn.
Those balls just smoke. With that control of
yours you could hit a coin. They can’t touch you.
They’ll be rolling over and playing dead.”</p>

<p>“That listens good,” laughed Joe. “At that,
I’ll need all I’ve got to make those fellows be
good.”</p>

<p>The preliminary practice gave evidence that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
game would be for blood. Both teams were on
their toes, and the dazzling plays that featured
their work brought frequent roars of applause
from the Giant and Brooklyn rooters. Then the
bell rang, the umpire dusted off the plate and the
vast throng settled down with delighted anticipation
to watch the game.</p>

<p>The Brooklyns, as the visiting team, went first
to bat. A roar went up from the stands as Joe
walked out to the mound. The Giant rooters
promptly put the game down as won. But the
Brooklyns pinned their faith to their phenomenal
pitcher, Dizzy Rance, and had different ideas
about the outcome of the game.</p>

<p>The first inning was short and sweet. Leete,
the leftfielder of the Dodgers, who, year in and
year out, had a batting average of .300 or better,
swung savagely at the first ball pitched and raised
a skyscraping fly that Jackwell at third promptly
gathered in. Mornier, with the count at three
balls and two strikes, sent up a foul that Mylert
caught close to the stands after a long run. Tonsten
lunged at the first ball and missed. The second
was a beauty that cut the outer corner of the
plate at which he did not offer and which went for
a strike. Then Joe shot over a high fast one and
struck him out.</p>

<p>“Atta boy, Joe!” and similar shouts of encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
came from stands and bleachers, as Joe
pulled off his glove and went in to the bench.</p>

<p>Rance, the Brooklyn pitcher, did not lack a generous
round of applause as he took up his position
in the box. He had already pitched two games
against the Giants and won them both. But he
had never happened to be pitted against Joe, and
despite his air of confidence he knew he had his
work cut out for him.</p>

<p>Curry made a good try on the second ball
pitched and sent a long fly to center that was
caught by Maley after a long run. Iredell sent a
sharp single to left. Burkett slammed one off
Rance’s shins, and the ball rolled between short
and second. Before it could be recovered, Burkett
had reached first and Iredell was safe at second.
Wheeler tried to wait Rance out, but when the
count had reached three and two he sent a single
to center that scored Iredell from second and carried
Burkett to third. A moment later the latter
was caught napping by a snap throw from catcher
to third and came in sheepishly to the bench.
Rance then put on steam and set Jackwell down on
three successive strikes.</p>

<p>“There’s one of the runs we promised you,
Joe,” sang out Larry, as the Giants took the field.</p>

<p>“That’s good as far as it goes,” laughed Joe.
“But don’t forget I’m looking for more.”</p>

<p>For the Brooklyns, Trench was an easy out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a roller to Joe, who ran over and tagged him on
the base line. Naylor dribbled one to Jackwell
that rolled so slowly that the batter reached first.
But no damage was done, for Joe pitched an outcurve
to Maley and made him hit into a fast
double play, Iredell to Barrett to Burkett.</p>

<p>It was snappy pitching, backed up by good support,
and that it was appreciated was shown by
the shouts that came from the Giant rooters, who
cheered until Joe had to remove his cap.</p>

<p>But Rance, although the Giants had got to him
for three hits in the first inning, showed strength
in the second that delighted his supporters. He
mowed the Giants down as fast as they came to
the bat.</p>

<p>The best that Larry could do was to lift a towering
fly to center that was taken care of by Maley.
Bowen lifted a twisting foul that the Brooklyn
catcher did not have to stir out of his tracks to
get. Joe hit a smoking liner that was superbly
caught by Tonsten, who had to go up in the air
for it, but held on.</p>

<p>In the Brooklyns’ third, Joe made a great play
on a well-placed bunt by Reis that rolled between
the box and third base. Joe slipped and fell as
he grasped it, but while in a sitting position he
shot it over to first in time to nail the runner.
Rance hit a sharp bounder to the box that Joe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
fielded in plenty of time. Tighe went out on a
Texas leaguer that was gathered in by Larry.</p>

<p>“That boy’s got ’em eating out of his hand,”
exulted Robbie, his red face beaming with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Yes, now,” agreed the more cautious McRae.
“But at any time they may turn and bite the hand
that’s feeding them. They’re an ungrateful lot.”</p>

<p>In their half of the inning, the Giants failed to
score. Rance was pitching like a house afire.
Mylert went back to the bench after three futile
offers at the elusive sphere. Curry popped a weak
fly to Trench, and, Iredell, after fouling the ball
off half a dozen times, grounded to Mornier at
first, who only had to step on the bag to register
an out.</p>

<p>It was Larry’s turn to be in the limelight in the
Brooklyns’ half of the fourth. Leete raised a fly
that seemed destined to fall between second and
left. It was certain that Wheeler at left could
not get to it in time, though he came in racing like
an express train. But Larry had started at the
crack of the bat, running in the direction of the
ball. He reached it just as it was going over his
head, and with a wild leap grasped it with one
hand and held on to it.</p>

<p>It was one of the finest catches ever made on
the Polo Grounds. For a moment the crowd sat
stupefied. Then, when they realized that a baseball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
“miracle” had occurred, they raised a din that
could have been heard a mile away.</p>

<p>“Great stuff, Larry, old boy!” congratulated
Joe, as the second baseman resumed his position.
“No pitcher could ask for any better support than
that.”</p>

<p>“Let that go for my share of your birthday
present,” returned the grinning Larry.</p>

<p>The next two went out in jig time, one on a
grounder and the other on strikes.</p>

<p>The Giants added one more run in their half
of the fourth by a clever combination of bunts and
singles. Joe knew that Rance was weak on fielding
bunts, and he directed his men to play on that
weakness. The Brooklyn pitcher fell all over himself
in trying to handle them, and this had a double
advantage, for it not only let men get on bases
but it shook for a moment the morale of the boxman
and made it easier for the succeeding batsman.
It was only by virtue of a lucky double play
that Rance got by with only one run scored against
him in that inning.</p>

<p>With two runs to the good, the Giants went out
on the field in a cheerful mood. They were getting
onto the redoubtable Rance, not heavily, but
still they were hitting him. Joe, on the other hand,
seemed to be invincible. He was not trying for
strike-outs except when necessary. But his curves
were working perfectly, his control was marvelous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and when a third strike was in order he called
upon his hop ball or his fadeaway and it did the
trick.</p>

<p>And the boys behind him were certainly backing
him up in fine style. They were fairly “eating
up” everything that came their way, digging them
out of the dirt, spearing them out of the air,
throwing with the precision of expert riflemen.
None of them was playing that day for records.
They were playing for the team. Already the new
spirit that Joe had infused as captain was beginning
to tell.</p>

<p>In the Giant’s half of the fifth, Joe was the first
man up. Rance tried him on an outcurve, but Joe
refused to bite. The next was a fast, straight
one, and Joe caught it fairly for a terrific smash
over the centerfielder’s head. The outfield had
gone back when he first came to the bat, but they
had not gone back far enough. It was a whale
of a hit, and Joe trotted home easily, even then
reaching the plate before Maley had laid his hand
on the ball.</p>

<p>“Frozen hoptoads!” cried Robbie, fairly jumping
up and down in exultation. “It’s a murderer
he is. He isn’t satisfied with anything less than
killing the ball.”</p>

<p>“He’s some killer, all right,” assented McRae.
“With one other man like him on the team, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
race would be over. The Giants would simply
walk in with the flag.”</p>

<p>That mammoth hit should have been the beginning
of a rally, but Rance tightened up and the
next three went out in order, one on strikes and
the other two on infield outs.</p>

<p>Joe still had control of the situation, and he
seemed to grow more unhittable as the game went
on. He simply toyed with his opponents, and
their vain attempts to land on the ball made them
at times seem ludicrous.</p>

<p>“Sure, Joe, ’tis a shame what you’re doin’ to
those poor boobs,” chuckled Larry, as they came
in to the bench together.</p>

<p>“But don’t forget that they’re always dangerous,”
cautioned Joe. “Do you remember the fourteen
runs they made in one of their games against
the Phillies? They may stage a comeback any
minute.”</p>

<p>“Not while you’re in the box, old boy,” declared
Larry. “You’ll have to break a leg to lose
this game.”</p>

<p>Burkett thought it was up to him to do something,
and lammed out a terrific liner to left for
three bases, sliding into third just a fraction of a
second before the return of the ball. Wheeler
tried to sacrifice, but Tonsten held Burkett at
third by a threatening gesture before putting out
Wheeler at first. With the infield pulled in for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a play at the plate, Jackwell double-crossed them
by a single over short that scored Burkett with
the fourth run for the Giants. Barrett went out
on a grounder to Mornier, Jackwell taking second.
Bowen made a determined effort to bring
him in, but his long fly to center was gathered in
by Maley.</p>

<p>The “lucky seventh” was misnamed as far as
the Brooklyns were concerned, for their luck was
conspicuous by its absence. Although the heavy
end of their batting order was up, they failed to
get the ball out of the infield. Leete, their chief
slugger, was utterly bewildered by Joe’s offerings
and struck out among the jeers of the Giant fans.
Mornier popped up a fly that Joe gobbled up,
and Larry had no trouble in getting Tonsten’s
grounder into the waiting hands of Burkett.</p>

<p>The Giants did a little better, and yet were unable
to add to their score. Joe started off with a
ripping single to left. Mylert tried to advance
him by sacrificing, but after sending up two fouls
was struck out by Rance. Curry sent a liner to
the box that was too hot to handle, but Rance
deflected it to Tonsten who got Curry at first, Joe
in the meantime getting to second. Iredell was an
easy victim, driving the ball straight into the
hands of Mornier at first.</p>

<p>“Well, Joe,” chuckled Jim, as the eighth inning
began, “we haven’t given you your present yet, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
we’re in a fair way to put it over. Not to say
that you’re not earning most of the present yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care how it comes as long as we get
it,” laughed Joe, as he slipped on his glove.</p>

<p>The time was now growing fearfully short in
which the men from the other side of the bridge
could make their final bid for the game. Those
four runs that the Giants had scored were like so
many mountains to be scaled, and with the airtight
pitching that Joe was handing out, it seemed
like an impossible task.</p>

<p>Still, they had pulled many a game out of the
fire with even greater odds against them, and they
came up to the plate determined to do it again,
if it were at all possible.</p>

<p>Trench got a ball just where he liked it, and
sent it whistling to left field for a single. Naylor
followed with a fierce grasser that Iredell knocked
down, but could not field in time to catch the
runner. It looked like the beginning of a rally,
and the Brooklyn bench was in commotion. Their
coaches on the base lines jumped up and down,
alternately shouting encouragement to their men
and hurling gibes at Joe in the attempt to rattle
him.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him going now,” yelled one.</p>

<p>“We’ve just been kidding him along so far,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
shouted another. “All together now, boys! Send
him to the showers!”</p>

<p>Maley came next, with orders to strike at the
first ball pitched. He followed orders and
missed. Again he swung several inches under
Joe’s throw, which took a most tantalizing hop
just before it reached the plate.</p>

<p>He set himself for the third and caught it
fairly. The ball started as a screaming liner, going
straight for the box. Joe leaped in the air
and caught it in his gloved hand. Like a flash
he turned and hurled it to Larry at second.
Trench, who had started for third at the crack
of the ball, tried frantically to scramble back to
second, but was too late. Larry wheeled and
shot down the ball to first, beating Naylor to the
bag by an eyelash. Three men had been put out
in the twinkling of an eye!</p>

<p>It was the first triple play that had been made
that season, and the third that had been made
on the Polo Grounds since that famous park had
been opened. It had all occurred so quickly that
half the spectators did not for the moment realize
what had occurred. But they woke up, and roar
after roar rose from the stands as the spectators
saw the Giants running in gleefully, while the discomfited
Brooklyns, with their rally nipped in
the bud, went out gloomily to their positions.</p>

<p>“You’ll send him to the showers, will you?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
yelled Larry to the Brooklyn coaches, as he threw
his cap hilariously into the air.</p>

<p>Rance’s face was a study as he took his place
in the box. He saw his winning streak going
glimmering. It was a hard game for him to lose,
for he had pitched in a way that would have won
most games. But he had drawn a hard assignment
in having to face pitching against which
his teammates, fence breakers as they usually
were, could make no headway.</p>

<p>Still, he was game, and there was still another
inning, and nothing was impossible in baseball.
If the Giants had expected him to crack, they
were quickly undeceived. Burkett grounded out
to Trench, who made a rattling stop and got him
at first with feet to spare. Wheeler fouled out
to Tighe. Jackwell went out on three successive
strikes.</p>

<p>It was a plucky exhibition of pitching under
discouraging conditions, and Rance well deserved
the hand that he received as he went in to the
bench.</p>

<p>“I say, Joe,” remarked Jim, as his chum was
preparing to go out for the ninth Brooklyn inning.
“Celebrate your birthday by showing those birds
the three-men-to-a-game stunt. It will be a
glorious wind-up.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see,” replied Joe, with a grin that was half
a promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Thompson, the manager of the Brooklyns, who
had been having a little run-in with the umpire,
and was standing in a disgruntled mood near the
batter’s box, overheard the dialogue and stared in
wonderment at Jim.</p>

<p>“What’s that three-men-to-a-game stunt you’re
talking about?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever heard of it?” asked Jim.</p>

<p>“I never have,” replied Thompson. “And I
was in the game before you were born.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got a treat in store for you,”
Jim assured him. “Just you watch this inning,
and you’ll see that only three men will be needed
to turn your men back without a run, or even the
smell of a hit. They’ll be the pitcher, the catcher
and the first baseman. The rest of the Giants
will have nothing to do and might as well be
off the field. In fact, if it wasn’t against the
regulations of the game, we would call them into
the bench just now.”</p>

<p>Thompson looked at Jim as though he were
crazy.</p>

<p>“Trying to kid me?” the Brooklyn manager
asked, with a savage inflection in his voice.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Jim, grinning cheerfully.
“Just keep your eye on that pitcher of ours.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>AN AMAZING FEAT</small></h2>


<p>Thompson, still believing that Jim was trying
to get a rise out of him, walked back to his
own bench, growling to himself.</p>

<p>Reis was the first to face Joe in the last half
of the ninth. Joe measured him carefully, took
his time in winding up, and then, with all the signs
of delivering a fast high one, sent over a floater
that Reis reached for and hit into the dirt in
front of the plate. Joe ran on it, picked it up
and tossed it to Burkett for an easy out.</p>

<p>Rance, the Brooklyn pitcher, came to the plate.
Joe sent over a hop that Rance caught on the
under side for a foul high up back of the rubber
that Mylert caught without moving from his
position.</p>

<p>With two out, Tighe missed the first one that
came over so fast that it had settled in Mylert’s
glove before the batter had completed his swing.
The next he fouled off for strike two. Then Joe
whizzed over his old reliable fadeaway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re out!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>The game was over and the Giants had beaten
their redoubtable foes by a score of four to none.
They had whitewashed their opponents and broken
their winning streak.</p>

<p>And what was sweeter to Jim at the moment
was that Joe had fulfilled his prediction. Only
the pitcher, catcher and first baseman had been
necessary to turn the Brooklyns back. The other
six men of the Giant team had had nothing to do
and might as well have been off the field. It was
almost magical pitching, the climax of the art.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim grinned at each other in a knowing
way as the former came into the bench.</p>

<p>“You pulled it off that time all right, Joe!”
exclaimed Jim gleefully, as he threw his arm
around his chum’s shoulder. “I piped off Thompson
to what you were going to do and he thought
I had gone nutty. He’d have given me an awful
razz if it had failed to go through.”</p>

<p>“You were taking awful chances,” laughed
Joe. “Of course, I might do that once in a
while, but only a superman could do it all the
time. But in this inning, luck was with us.”</p>

<p>Thompson at this moment came strolling over
toward them. He was evidently consumed with
curiosity.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the wind out of your sails at the
start by admitting that you put one over on me,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
he said, addressing himself to Jim. “Though
how you knew what was about to happen is beyond
me. How did you do it?” he asked, turning
to Joe. “Have you got a horseshoe or rabbit’s
foot concealed about you?”</p>

<p>“I assure you that I have nothing up my sleeve
to deceive you,” Joe said, rolling up his sleeves
in the best manner of the professional conjurer.
“It simply means that the hand is quicker than
the eye.”</p>

<p>“Cut out the funny stuff and tell me just how
you did it,” persisted Thompson.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said McRae, who had been an
amused listener to the conversation. “That’s an
old trick of Joe’s that he’s tried out when we’ve
been playing exhibition games in the spring training
practice. More than once, we’ve called in
the whole team, except Joe, the catcher, and the
first baseman. Then Joe’s done just what he
did this afternoon. Of course, it doesn’t always
go through, but in many cases he has put it over.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t another pitcher in the League who
would dare try it!” exclaimed Thompson.</p>

<p>“There’s only one Matson in the world,” said
McRae simply. “On the level, Thompson, what
would you give to have him on your team?”</p>

<p>“A quarter of a million dollars,” blurted out
Thompson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“You couldn’t have him for half a million,”
said McRae, with a grin, as he turned away.</p>

<p>It was a jubilant crowd of Giants that gathered
in the clubhouse after the game.</p>

<p>“How was that for your birthday present,
Joe?” sang out Larry. “It wasn’t quite what
you asked for, but it was the best we could do.”</p>

<p>“It was plenty,” laughed Joe. “I’d rather
have those runs you gave me than a diamond
ring. Keep it up, boys, and we’ll soon be up at
the top of the League. We’ve been a long time in
getting started, but now just watch our smoke.
This game pulls us out of the second division.
We’re right on the heels of the Brooklyns. Let’s
give those fellows to-morrow the same dose they
got to-day. Then we’ll get after the Pittsburghs
and the Chicagos.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” cried Larry. “We’ll show
’em where they get off. They’ve been hogging
the best seats in this show. Now we’ll send ’em
back to the gallery.”</p>

<p>Joe smiled happily at the enthusiasm of the
boys. It was what he had been trying to instill
ever since he had been made the captain of the
team. He knew that the material was there&mdash;the
batting, the fielding, and the pitching. But
all this counted for nothing as long as the spirit
was lacking, the will to victory, the confidence
that they could win.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>There was just one piece of the machinery,
however, that was not working smoothly, and
that was Iredell. He had been sulky and mutinous
ever since he had been displaced by Joe in
the captaincy of the team. Joe had been most
considerate and had gone out of his way to be
kind to him, but all his advances had been rebuffed.</p>

<p>“You’re certainly getting the team into fine
shape, Joe,” said Jim, as they made their way out
of the grounds. “They played championship ball
behind you this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“They sure did,” agreed Joe. “Those plays
by Larry, especially, were sparklers. I never saw
the old boy in better form. He’s one of the veterans
of the game, and you might expect him to
be slipping, but to-day he played like a youngster
with all a veteran’s skill. If everybody had the
same spirit, I’d have nothing more to ask.”</p>

<p>“Meaning Iredell, I suppose,” said Jim.</p>

<p>“Just him,” replied Joe. “It isn’t that there’s
anything especially I can lay my hands on. He
plays good mechanical ball. His fielding is good
and he’s keeping up fairly well with the stick. But
the mischief of it is, it’s all mechanical. He’s
like a galvanized dead man going through the
motions, but a dead man just the same. I wish
I could put some life into him. After a while, that
dulness of his will begin to affect the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
team. It takes only one drop of ink to darken
a whole glass of water.”</p>

<p>“I noticed that in the clubhouse this afternoon,”
said Jim thoughtfully, “all the rest of the fellows
were bubbling over, while he sat apart with
a frown on his face as though we’d lost the game
instead of having won it.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll have to get over that and get over
it quickly,” said Joe with decision. “We can’t
have him casting a wet blanket over the rest of
the team. The trouble is, we haven’t any one
available to put in his place just now, and it’s
hard to get one at this stage of the season. Renton’s
a likely youngster, but he needs a little more
seasoning before I could trust him in such a responsible
position as that of shortstop.”</p>

<p>“If that Mornsby deal had only gone through,
we’d have had a crackerjack,” said Jim regretfully.</p>

<p>“We sure would!” replied Joe. “But I felt
from the beginning that we didn’t have much
chance of getting him. If the St. Louis management
had let him go, they might as well have shut
up shop. The fans would have hooted them out
of town. Anyway, I’d rather develop a player
than buy him. I’m going to coach young Renton
with a possible view to taking Iredell’s place, if
it becomes necessary.”</p>

<p>The next day Brooklyn again came to the Polo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Grounds, determined to regain their lost laurels
of the day before. This time they relied on Reuter,
while McRae sent Jim into the box.</p>

<p>That Reuter was good, became evident before
the game had gone very far. He had a world
of speed and his curves were breaking well. Up
to the seventh inning, only two hits had been made
off of him, one of which was a homer by Joe and
another a two-base hit by Burkett. His support
was superb, and more than one apparent hit was
turned into an out by clever fielding.</p>

<p>Jim, in the early innings, was not up to his
usual mark. He had most of the stuff that had
given him such high repute as a pitcher, except that
he could not handle his wide-breaking curve with
his usual skill. The failure of that curve to break
over the plate got him several times in the hole.
He relied too much also on his slow ball when,
with the dull, cloudy weather that prevailed, speed
would have been more effective.</p>

<p>But, although he was not in his best form, his
courage never faltered. He was game in the
pinches. Leete, for instance, in the fifth inning,
laced the first ball pitched into leftfield for a
clean homer. There was no one out when the
mighty clout was made, but Jim refused to be disconcerted.
He struck out Mornier, the heavy
hitting first baseman of the Dodgers, made Tonsten
hit a slow roller to the box that went for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
easy out, and fanned Trench, after the latter had
sent up two fouls in his unavailing attempt to hit
the ball squarely.</p>

<p>Again in the sixth, after a triple and a single
in succession had scored another run, he settled
down and mowed the next three down in order.</p>

<p>But though his nerve was with him, the Brooklyn
batsmen kept getting to him, picking up one
run after the other until at the end of the seventh
inning they had four runs to their credit
while only one lone score had been made by the
Giants. The Brooklyn rooters were jubilant, for
it looked as though their pets had just about
sewed up the game.</p>

<p>But in the Giants’ half of the eighth Reuter
began to crack. He started well enough by making
Curry pop to Mornier. Iredell came next and
shot a single to left, his first hit of the game and
the third that had been made off Reuter up to
that time. Then Burkett followed suit with a
beauty to right that sent Iredell to third, though
a good return throw by Reis held Burkett to the
initial bag.</p>

<p>The two hits in succession seemed to affect Reuter’s
control, and he gave Wheeler a base on balls.
Now the bags were full, with only one man out,
and the Giant rooters, who had hitherto been
glum, were standing up in their places and shouting
like mad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>McRae sent Ledwith, a much faster man than
Wheeler, to take the latter’s place on first, while
he himself ran out on the coaching line and Robbie
scurried in the direction of third.</p>

<p>Jackwell was next at bat, and the chances were
good for a double play by Brooklyn. But Reuter’s
tired arm had lost its cunning and, try as
he would, he could not get the ball over the plate.
Amid a pandemonium of yells from the excited
fans he passed Jackwell to first, forcing a run over
the plate. And still the bases were full.</p>

<p>It was evident that Reuter was “through,” and
Thompson signaled him to come in. He took off
his glove and walked into the bench to a chorus
of sympathetic cheers from the partisans of both
sides in recognition of the superb work he had
done up to that fateful inning.</p>

<p>Grimm took his place and tossed a few balls
to the catcher in order to warm up. It was a hard
assignment to take up the pitcher’s burden with
the bases full.</p>

<p>The first ball he put over came so near to
“beaning” Larry that the latter only saved himself
by dropping to the ground. McRae signaled
to him to wait the pitcher out. He did so, with
the result that he, too, trotted to first on four
bad balls, forcing another run home and making
the score four to three in favor of the Brooklyns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Grimm braced for the next man, Bowen, and
struck him out, as Bowen let even good balls go
by, hoping to profit by the pitcher’s wildness. But
this time he reckoned without his host and retired
discomfited to the bench.</p>

<p>Joe came next and received a mighty hand as
he went to the plate. His three comrades on the
bases implored him to bring them home.</p>

<p>Grimm was in a dilemma. Under ordinary
circumstances he would have passed Joe and taken
a chance on Mylert. But to pass him now meant
the forcing home of another run, which would
have tied the score. On the other hand, a clean
hit would bring at least two men home and put
the Giants ahead. There was still, however, the
third chance&mdash;that Joe might not make a hit. In
that case there would be three men out, leaving
the Brooklyns ahead.</p>

<p>He took the third alternative and pitched to
Joe, putting all the stuff he had on the ball. Joe
swung at it and missed. Two balls followed in
succession. Then he whizzed over a high, fast
one that Joe caught fairly and sent out on a line
between left and center for a sizzling triple, clearing
the bases and himself coming into third standing
up.</p>

<p>The Giants and their partisans went wild with
joy as the three men followed each over the plate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
making the score six to four in favor of the
home team.</p>

<p>And at that figure the score remained, for Jim
pitched like a man possessed in the Brooklyn’s
half of the ninth and set them down as fast as
they came to the bat.</p>

<p>“That’s what you call pulling the game out of
the fire,” exulted Larry, as the Giants were holding
a jubilee in the clubhouse after the game.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jim. “But it was a hard game
for Reuter to lose. He outpitched me up to that
fatal eighth inning. He had a world of stuff on
the ball.”</p>

<p>“He’s a crackerjack, all right,” agreed Joe.
“And it certainly looked as though he had us
going.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t have you going much that I could
notice, except going around the bases,” declared
Larry, with a wide grin. “That was a corking
homer of yours, and the triple was almost as
good.”</p>

<p>“Better, as far as the results were concerned,”
put in Jim. “For it brought home three men
and settled the game. It was a life saver, and no
mistake. Talk about Johnny on the spot. Joe
on the spot is the salvation of the Giants!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>CLEVER STRATEGY</small></h2>


<p>“Quit your kidding,” laughed Joe. “Let’s just
say that the breaks of the game were with us
and let it go at that. The main thing is that
we’ve put another game on the right side of the
ledger. We’ve turned the Brooklyns back, and
now it’s up to us to give the same dose to the
Bostons and the Phillies.”</p>

<p>“They’ll be easy,” prophesied Curry, as he finished
fastening his shoe laces.</p>

<p>“Don’t fool yourself,” cautioned Joe. “They’re
playing better now than they were earlier in the
season, and they won’t be such cinches as they
were in the last series. We’ll have to step lively
to beat them, and keep trying every minute. Ginger’s
the word from now on.”</p>

<p>“Ginger” had been his watchword ever since
he had been made captain of the team. He had
tried to inspire them with his own indomitable
energy and vim, and was gratified to see that with
the exception of Iredell he was succeeding. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
was doubly necessary in the case of the Giants,
for most of the team was composed of veterans.
They were superb players, but some of them were
letting up on their speed and needed prodding to
keep them at the top of their form.</p>

<p>Still there had been an infusion of new blood,
and McRae was constantly on the lookout for
more. The Giants’ roster contained a number
of promising rookies, such as Renton, Ledwith,
Merton and others, and Joe was constantly coaching
them in the fine points of the game.</p>

<p>In Merton, especially, he thought he had all
the material of a promising pitcher. The youngster
had been obtained from the Oakland Seals,
and had won a high reputation in the Pacific
Coast League. He had speed, a good assortment
of curves, and a fair measure of control. But
pitching against big leaguers was a very different
matter from trying to outguess minor league batters,
and Joe had not thought it advisable as yet
to send him in for a full game.</p>

<p>One of his chief faults was that opponents
could steal bases on him with comparative impunity.
It was almost uncanny to note the ease
with which a runner on the bases could detect
whether Merton was going to pitch to the batter
or throw the ball to first. Joe was not long in
discovering the reason.</p>

<p>“Here’s your trouble, Merton,” he said. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
invariably lift your right heel from the ground
when you are about to throw to the plate. You
keep it on the ground when you’re planning to
throw to first. So, by watching you, those fellows
can get a long lead off first and easily make
second. Just try now, and see.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” admitted Merton, after practising
a few minutes. “Funny that I never noticed
that before. But none of the fellows in the Pacific
Coast League noticed it, either. They didn’t steal
much on me there.”</p>

<p>“That’s just because they were minor leaguers,”
returned Joe. “But you’re in big-league company
now, and the wise birds on the other teams get
on to you at once.”</p>

<p>Merton was grateful for the tip, and practised
assiduously until he had got rid of the mannerism.
He was docile and willing to learn, and Joe could
see his pitching ability increase from day to day.</p>

<p>Not only in pitching, but in batting, Joe was
able to be of incalculable value to the younger
members of the team. How to outguess the
pitcher, when to wait him out, how to walk into
the ball instead of drawing away from it, the best
way of laying down bunts&mdash;these and a host of
other things in which he was a past master were
freely imparted to his charges and illustrated by
object lessons that were even more effective than
the spoken word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>McRae and Robbie were delighted with the
results of the change of captains, and more and
more they gave him a free hand, knowing that
Joe would get out of the Giants all that was in
them. And, knowing the power of the Giant machine
when going at full speed, that was all that
they asked.</p>

<p>The next series on the Giants’ schedule was
with the Boston Braves on the latter’s grounds.
As Joe had anticipated, the Braves put up a much
stiffer fight than they had earlier in the season.
They were going well, had already passed the
Phillies and the Cardinals and were making a
desperate attempt to get into the first division.</p>

<p>Markwith pitched the first game, and did very
well until the last two frames. Then a veritable
torrent of hits broke from the Bostons’ bats and
drove the southpaw from the mound. Joe took his
place, and the hitting suddenly ceased. But the
damage had already been done, and the game was
placed in the Boston column.</p>

<p>Jim pitched in the second game and chalked up
a victory. Young Merton was given his chance
in the third, and justified Joe’s confidence by also
winning, although the score was close.</p>

<p>Joe himself went in for the fourth and won,
thus getting three out of four in the series, which,
for a team on the road, was not to be complained
of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>With the Phillies, on the latter’s grounds, the
Giants cleaned up the first three games right off
the reel. In the fourth, the Phillies woke up and
played like champions. They fielded and batted
like demons, so well indeed that when the ninth
inning began, the Phillies were ahead by a score
of three to two.</p>

<p>In the Giants’ half, with one man on base, Joe
cut loose with a homer that put his team a run to
the good. Not daunted, however, the Phillies
came in for their half. Two men were out, and
a couple of Giant fumbles had permitted two to
get on the bases.</p>

<p>Mallinson, the heaviest batter of the Phillies,
was up. He shook his bat menacingly and glared
at Joe. With the team behind him the least bit
shaky on account of the fumbles, Joe tried a new
stunt on Mallinson.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell you exactly the kind of a ball
I’m going to throw to you,” he remarked, with
a disarming grin.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are,” sneered Mallinson, unbelievingly,
while even Mylert, the Giant catcher, looked
bewildered.</p>

<p>“Honest Injun,” declared Joe. “This first one
is going to be a high fast one right over the plate
and just below the shoulder.”</p>

<p>“G’wan and stop your kidding,” growled the
burly Philadelphia batter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>He set himself for a curve, not believing for a
moment that Joe would be crazy enough to tell
him in advance what he was going to pitch. It
was just on that disbelief that Joe had counted.</p>

<p>Joe wound up and hurled one over exactly as
he had promised. Mallinson, all set for a curve,
was so flustered that he struck at it hurriedly and
missed.</p>

<p>Joe grinned tantalizingly, while Mallinson
glowered at him.</p>

<p>“Didn’t believe me, did you?” Joe asked. “Why
don’t you have more faith in your fellow men?
I ought to be real peeved at you for your lack of
confidence. But I’m of a forgiving nature and
I’ll overlook it this time.”</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” snapped Mallinson savagely. “Go
ahead and play the game.”</p>

<p>“No pleasing some fellows,” mourned Joe
plaintively. “Now this time, I’m going to pitch
an outcurve. Ready? Let’s go.”</p>

<p>Mallinson, sure that this time he was going
to be double-crossed, got ready for a high fast
one, and the outcurve that Joe pitched cut the
corner of the plate and settled in Mylert’s glove
for the second strike.</p>

<p>“You see!” complained Joe. “There you are
again. What’s the use of my tipping you off if
you don’t take advantage? Don’t you believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
me? Doesn’t anybody ever tell the truth in
Philadelphia?”</p>

<p>Mallinson tried to say something, but he was
so mad that he could only stutter, while his face
looked as though he were going to have a fit of
apoplexy.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Joe, “this is your last chance.
I’m going to give you my hop ball this time, and
that’s just because it’s you. I wouldn’t do it for
everybody. It’ll take a jump just as it comes
to the plate.”</p>

<p>By this time Mallinson was in an almost pitiable
state of bewilderment. Would the pitcher
again keep his word? Or would Joe figure that
now that he had twice tipped him off correctly,
Mallinson would really get set for the hop ball
and that now was the time to fool him with something
else?</p>

<p>He was so up in the air by this time that he
could not have hit a balloon, and he struck six
inches below the hop ball that Joe sent whistling
over the plate for an out. The game was over
and the Giants had won.</p>

<p>“What was all that chatter that was going on
between you and Mallinson?” asked McRae, as he
and Robbie, with their faces all smiles, came up
to Joe. “I couldn’t quite get what it was from
the bench. But you seemed to get his goat for
fair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe told them, and the pair went into paroxysms
of laughter, Robbie choking until they had to
pound him on the back.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete, Mac!” he gurgled, as
soon as he could speak, “you’ll have to do something
with this fellow or he’ll be the death of
me yet. To win a ball game just by telling the
batsman what he was going to pitch to him! Did
you ever hear anything like it before in your life?”</p>

<p>“I never did,” replied the grinning McRae.</p>

<p>At the clubhouse later, there were guffaws of
laughter as Mylert described the way that Joe
had stood Mallinson on his head.</p>

<p>“And me thinking Joe had simply gone nutty!”
Mylert said. “When he pitched that first ball
just as he said, I didn’t know where I was at.
Then the second one got me going still more. But
I saw that it had Mallinson going, too, and then
I began to catch on. How on earth did you ever
come to think of that, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Just a matter of psychology,” Jim answered
for him. “And mighty good psychology, if you
ask me. Baseball Joe’s a dabster at that.”</p>

<p>“Sike-sike what?” asked Larry, whose vocabulary
was not very extensive.</p>

<p>“Psychology,” repeated Jim, with a grin. “No,
it isn’t a new kind of breakfast food. Joe simply
knew how Mallinson’s mind would work and he
took advantage of it. Mallinson coppered everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Joe said to him. He figured that Joe was
there to deceive him. He couldn’t conceive that
Joe would tell him the truth. And so it was just
by telling the truth that Joe got him.”</p>

<p>“It just got by because it was new,” laughed
Joe. “I couldn’t do it often, for if I did they’d
begin to take me at my word, and then they’d
bat me all over the lot.”</p>

<p>By the time the Eastern inter-city games were
over, the Giants had considerably bettered their
team standing. They had passed the Brooklyns,
who had let down a good deal and were now
playing in-and-out ball. The Chicagos were still
in the lead, with Pittsburgh three games behind
them, but pressing them closely. Then came the
Giants, two games in the rear of the men from
the Smoky City. The Cincinnati Reds brought
up the rear of the first division, but the conviction
was strong in the minds of the Giants that it
was either the Pirates or the Cubs they had to
beat in order to win the pennant.</p>

<p>On the eve of the invasion of the East by
the Western teams, McRae called his men together
for a heart-to-heart talk in the clubhouse.</p>

<p>“You boys know that I can give you the rough
edge of my tongue when you lay down on me,”
he said, as he looked around on the group of
earnest young athletes, who listened to him with
respectful attention. “But you know, too, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
I’m always ready to give a man credit when he
deserves it. I’m glad to say that just now I’m
proud of the men who wear the Giant uniform.
You’ve done good work in cleaning up the Eastern
teams. You’ve played ball right up to the
end of the ninth inning, and many a game that
looked lost you’ve pulled out of the fire.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s all right as far as it goes. But
the Western clubs are coming, and they’re out for
scalps. You remember what they did to us on
our first trip out there. They gave us one of
the most disgraceful beatings we’ve had for years.
They took everything but our shirts, and they
nearly got those. Are you going to let them do
it again?”</p>

<p>There was a yell of dissent that warmed
McRae’s heart.</p>

<p>“That’s the right spirit,” he declared approvingly.
“Now, go in and show the same spirit on
the field that you’re showing in the clubhouse.
Beat them to a frazzle. Show them that you’re
yet the class of the League. Don’t be satisfied with
an even break. That won’t get us anywhere. Take
three out of four from every one of them. Make
a clean sweep if you can. Keep on your toes
every minute. You’ve got the pitching, you’ve
got the fielding, you’ve got the batting, and you’ve
got the best captain that ever wore baseball shoes.
What more does any club want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing!” shouted Larry. “We’ll wipe up
the earth with them!”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff,” replied McRae. “Now go
out and say it with your bats. I want another
championship this year, and I want it so bad that
it hurts. You’re the boys that can give it to me,
and I’m counting on you to do it. Show them
that you’re Giants not only in name, but in fact.
That’s about all.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with McRae?” cried
Curry, as the manager, having said his say, turned
to leave.</p>

<p>“He’s all right!” came in a thundering chorus
from all except Iredell, who maintained a moody
silence.</p>

<p>McRae waved his hand and vanished through
the door.</p>

<p>The Cincinnati Reds were the first of the invaders
to make their appearance at the Polo Grounds.
They always drew large crowds, not only because
they usually played good ball against the Giants,
but especially because of the popularity of Hughson,
their manager, who for many years had been
a mainstay of the Giants and the idol of New
York fans.</p>

<p>Hughson was one of the straight, clean, upstanding
men who are a credit to the national
game. McRae had taken him when he was a
raw rookie and given him his chance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Giants to show what he could do. The result had
been a sensation. In less than a year Hughson
had leaped into fame as the greatest pitcher in
the country. He had everything&mdash;courage, speed,
curves and control&mdash;and with them all a baseball
head that enabled him to outguess the craftiest
of his opponents.</p>

<p>For a dozen years he had been the chief reliance
of the Giants and one of the greatest drawing
cards in the game. At the time that Joe had joined
the Giants, however, Hughson’s arm was beginning
to fail. The latter was quick to discover
Joe’s phenomenal ability and, instead of showing
any mean jealousy, had done his best to develop
it. Between him and Joe a friendship had
sprung up that had never diminished.</p>

<p>Hughson’s services were in demand as a manager
and he was snapped up by the Cincinnati
club to take charge of the Reds. With rather
indifferent material to start with, he had built up
a strong team that had several times given the
Giants a hot race for the championship.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the first game, Hughson,
big and genial as ever, shook Joe’s hand warmly
when the latter met him near the plate.</p>

<p>“We’re going to give you the same dose that
we did when you were on our stamping ground
the last time, Joe,” he remarked, with a laugh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
after they had interchanged greetings. “I love
the Giants, but, oh, you Reds!”</p>

<p>“If you’re so sure of it, why go through the
trouble of playing the game?” retorted Joe.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have to do that as a matter of form
and to give the crowd their money’s worth,” joked
Hughson. “But honestly, Joe, we’re going to put
up the stiffest kind of a battle. My men have
their fighting clothes on, and they’re going good
just now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed that,” replied Joe. “You took
the Pirates neatly into camp in that last series.
The return of Haskins has plugged up a weak
point in your outfield. I see he didn’t lose his
batting eye while he was a hold-out.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Hughson, “he’s as good as ever.
I began to think we’d never come to terms on the
question of salary. You see, after his phenomenal
season last year he got a swelled head and
demanded a salary that was out of all reason.
Said he wouldn’t play this year unless he got it.
But we got together on a compromise at last, and
now he’s in uniform again and cavorting around
like a two-year-old. Wait until you see him knock
the ball out of the lot this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” retorted Joe with a grin, “and I’ll
bet I’ll wait a good long while.”</p>

<small>DEEPENING MYSTERY</small></h2>


<p>After a little more chaffing, Joe left Hughson
and walked over towards the Giants’ dugout. He
felt a touch on his shoulder and, turning around,
saw Jackwell.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dan?” he asked, noting at the
same time that the player was pale.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel quite in shape, Captain,” said
Jackwell in a voice that was far from steady.
“I was wondering whether you couldn’t put someone
in my place to-day.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Joe. “Look
here, Jackwell,” he went on sharply, “are you
trying to pull some of that ptomaine poisoning
stuff again? Because, if you are, I tell you right
now, you’re wasting your time.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it isn’t that,” stammered Jackwell, nervously
fingering his cap. “I just feel kind of
unstrung, shaky-like. I’m afraid I can’t play
the bag as it ought to be played, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Jackwell,” commanded Joe sternly, “come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
right out like a man and tell me what’s the matter
with you. Lay your cards on the table. Are
you playing for your release? Do you want to
go to some other team?”</p>

<p>“No, no! Nothing like that!” ejaculated Jackwell,
in alarm. “I’d rather play for the Giants
than for any other team in the country.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you straight that you won’t be
playing for the Giants or any other team very
long if this sort of thing keeps on,” said Joe
sharply. “What do you think this is, a sanitarium
for invalids? Here, McRae’s taken you from the
bush league and given you the chance of your
lives with the best team in the country. Do you
want to go back to the sticks?”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that,” muttered Jackwell, twisting
about uneasily.</p>

<p>“Then go out and play the game,” commanded
Joe. “I’m getting fed up with all this mystery
stuff. There’ll have to be a show-down before
long, unless you get back your nerve.”</p>

<p>Jackwell said no more and went back to the
bench, where he had a whispered colloquy with
Bowen, who seemed equally nervous.</p>

<p>When they went out to their positions, Joe
noticed that both had their caps drawn down over
their faces much more than usual. It could not
have been to keep the sun out of their eyes, for
clouds obscured the sky and rain threatened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately, that is, for the Giants, for despite
Hughson’s prediction, it was not the Reds’ winning
day. Jim pitched for the Giants, and though
he was nicked for seven hits, he was never in
danger and held his opponents all the way. He
did not have to extend himself, as his teammates,
by free batting, gave him a commanding lead as
early as the third inning, and after that the Giants
simply breezed in.</p>

<p>Allison was the first of the Cincinnati pitchers
to fall a victim to the fury of the Giants’ bats.
In the third inning, with the Giants one run to
the good, Barrett, the first man up, sent a sharp
single to left. Iredell followed with another in
almost identically the same place, and an error
by the Red shortstop filled the bases. Then Jackwell
singled sharply over second, bringing in two
runs.</p>

<p>It was clear that Allison’s usefulness for that
day was at an end, and Hughson replaced him by
Elkins. Bowen lifted a sacrifice to Gerry in center
and another run came over the plate. Mylert
doubled and Jackwell scampered home. Curry
hit to third and Mylert was tagged on the base
line. Burkett was passed, as was also Wheeler.
Then Joe, who, in the new shake-up of the batting
order, occupied the position of “clean-up”
man, justified the name by coming to the plate and
hammering out a mighty triple that cleared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
bases. There he was left, however, for Larry,
up for the second time in the same inning, popped
an easy fly that was gathered in by the second
baseman. Seven runs had been the fruit of that
avalanche of hits in that fateful inning.</p>

<p>From that time on it seemed only a question
of how big would be the score. Two other pitchers
were called into service by Hughson before
the game was over, and although the torrent of
Giant hits had almost spent its force, they came
often enough to keep the Red outfielders on the
jump.</p>

<p>In the eighth the Reds made a rally and succeeded
in getting three men on bases with only
one man out. But the rally ended suddenly when
Jim made Haskins, the star batter of the Reds,
hit to short for a snappy double play that ended
the inning.</p>

<p>No further runs were made by either side, and
the first game of the Western invasion went into
the Giants’ column by a score of ten to two.</p>

<p>In the clubhouse, after the game, Joe asked
Jackwell and Bowen to stay after the others had
gone, in order that he might have a word with
them.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to pry into your personal affairs,
boys,” he said to them kindly, when they were at
last left alone. “I’d be the last one to do that.
But I’m captain of this team, and I’ve got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
see that my men are in fit condition to play. And
if there’s anything that prevents you showing your
best form, it’s up to me to find just what it is.”</p>

<p>They made no answer, and Joe went on:</p>

<p>“I notice that whatever it is that’s bothering
you seems to affect you both. You both were sick,
or said you were, at the same time the other day.
You, Jackwell, told me that you were not feeling
fit to-day, and although Bowen didn’t say anything,
I suppose it was because you told him it
was of no use. I noticed that right after your
talk with me, you went back to Bowen and held
a whispered conversation with him. And when
you went out on the field, you both pulled your
caps over your faces more than usual.</p>

<p>“Then, too, neither of you played your usual
game to-day. Luckily, we had such a big lead
that the errors didn’t lose the game, but in a
close game any one of them might have been
fatal. That was a ridiculously easy grounder,
Jackwell, that you fumbled in the fourth, and in
the sixth you failed to back up Iredell on that
throw-in by Curry. And that was a bad muff
you, Bowen, made of Haskins’ fly to center, to
say nothing of the wild throw you made to second
right afterwards.</p>

<p>“Now, what’s the trouble? Let’s have a showdown.
Speak up.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>TROUBLE BREWING</small></h2>


<p>Still Jackwell and Bowen stood mute, neither
of them venturing to meet Joe’s gaze.</p>

<p>“If you don’t tell it to me, you’ll have to tell
it to McRae,” suggested Joe. “I’m trying to
let you down easy, without calling it to his attention.
If we can settle it among ourselves, so much
the better. Is it some trouble at home that’s
weighing on your mind? Is it something about
money matters? If it’s that, perhaps I can help
you out.”</p>

<p>“That’s very kind of you, Mr. Matson,” said
Jackwell, who seemed by common consent to be
the spokesman for the two. “But it isn’t either
of those two. It’s something else that neither Ben
nor I are quite ready yet to talk about.</p>

<p>“I know very well that you have a right to know
anything that’s interfering with our playing the
game as it ought to be played. And I’ll admit,
and I guess Ben will, too, that we were off our
game to-day. But I think we’ll soon be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
settle the trouble so it won’t bother us any more.</p>

<p>“I wish you could see your way clear to give
us a little more time. Let Ben and me have time
to think and talk it over together. If we can
settle the matter without letting any one else know
about it, we’d much rather do so.”</p>

<p>Joe pondered for a moment.</p>

<p>“I’m willing to go as far as this,” he announced
at last. “I’ll give you a little more time, on this
condition. If I note any further falling off in
your play, or you come to me with any excuses
to be let off from a game, I’m going to come down
on you like a load of brick. Then you’ll have to
come across, and come across quick, or you’ll be
put off the team. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Jackwell. “You won’t
have any further cause to complain of me, Mr.
Matson. I’ll play my very best.”</p>

<p>“I’ll work my head off to win,” declared Bowen.</p>

<p>They kept their promise in the series of games
with the Western teams that followed. Jackwell
played at third with a skill that brought back the
memory of Jerry Denny, and Bowen covered his
territory splendidly in the outfield. It seemed
as though Joe’s problem was solved, as far as they
were concerned.</p>

<p>But the worry about them was replaced by
another regarding Jim. There was no denying
that the latter was not doing his best work. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
was intensely loyal and wrapped up in the success
of the team. But the opposing teams were
getting to him much more freely than they had
before that season. He was getting by in many
of his games because the “breaks” happened to
be with him, and because the Giants, with the new
spirit that Joe had infused into them, were playing
a phenomenal fielding game. But there was
something missing.</p>

<p>There was nothing amiss in Jim’s physical condition.
His arm was in perfect shape and his
control as good as ever. But his mind was not
on the game, as it had formerly been. He worked
mechanically, sometimes abstractedly. He was
always trying, but it was as though he were applying
whip and spur to his energies, instead of having
them act joyously and spontaneously.</p>

<p>Joe knew perfectly well what was worrying
his chum. Ever since that involuntary hesitation
of Mabel’s, when asked about Clara, Jim had
been a different person. Where formerly he and
Joe had laughed and jested together on the closest
terms of friendship and mutual understanding,
there was now a shadow between them, a very
slight and nebulous shadow, but a shadow nevertheless.
Jim’s old jollity, the bubbling effervescence,
the sheer joy in living, were conspicuous
by their absence.</p>

<p>It was a matter that could not be talked about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and Joe, grieved to the heart, could only wait and
hope that the matter would be cleared up happily.
To his regret on his chum’s account was added
worry about the influence the trouble might have
on the chances of the Giants.</p>

<p>For if there was any weak place in the Giants’
armor, it was in the pitching staff. At the best, it
was none too strong. Joe himself, of course, was
a tower of strength, and Jim was one of the finest
twirlers in either League. But Markwith, though
still turning in a fair number of victories, was past
his prime and unquestionably on the down grade.
In another season or two, he would be ready for
the minors. Bradley was coming along fairly
well, and Merton, too, had all the signs of a comer,
but they were still too unseasoned to be depended
on.</p>

<p>If the deal for Hays had gone through, he
would have been a most welcome addition to the
ranks of the Giant boxmen. But the Yankees had
had a change of heart, and had decided to retain
him for a while.</p>

<p>So Joe’s dismay at the thought of Jim, his main
standby, letting down in his efficiency was amply
justified.</p>

<p>The Cincinnatis came back, as Hughson had
prophesied, and took the next game. But the two
following ones went into the Giants’ bat bag, and
with three out of four they felt that they had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
revenge for the trimming that had been handed
to them on their last trip to Redland.</p>

<p>St. Louis came next, and this time the Giants
made a clean sweep of the series. They were not
so successful with the Pittsburghs, and had to be
satisfied with an even break. But when the latter
went over the bridge the Brooklyns rose in their
might and took the whole four games right off
the reel, thus enabling the Giants to pass them
and take second place in the race.</p>

<p>Then came the Chicagos, who were still leading
the League, but only by the narrow margin of
one game. If the Giants could take three out of
four from them, the Cubs would fall to second
place.</p>

<p>Joe had made his pitching arrangements so that
he himself would pitch the first and fourth games.
He did so, and won them both. He had never
pitched with more superb skill, strength and confidence,
and the ordinarily savage Cubs were
forced to be as meek as lapdogs.</p>

<p>They got even, to an extent, with Markwith,
whom they fairly clawed to pieces in the second
game. Jim pitched in the third, and but for a
senseless play might have won.</p>

<p>That play was made by Iredell in the ninth
inning, with the Giants making their last stand.
The Cubs were three runs to the good. One man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was out in the Giants’ half, Curry was on third
and Iredell was on second, with Joe at the bat.</p>

<p>Suddenly, moved by what impulse nobody
knew, Iredell tried to steal third, forgetting for
the moment that it was already occupied.</p>

<p>“Back!” yelled Joe in consternation. “Go
back!”</p>

<p>With the shout, Iredell realized what he had
done, and turned to go back. But it was too late.
The Cub catcher had shot the ball down to second,
and Holstein, with a chuckle, clapped the ball on
Iredell as he slid into the bag.</p>

<p>A roar, partly of rage, partly of glee, rose from
the spectators, and Iredell was unmercifully joshed
as he made his way back to the bench.</p>

<p>Joe, a minute later, smashed out a terrific
homer on which Curry and he both dented the
plate. But the next man went out on strikes, and
with him went the game. If Iredell had been on
second, he also would have come home on Joe’s
circuit clout and the score would have been tied.
The game would have gone into extra innings,
with the Giants having at least an even chance
of victory.</p>

<p>As it was, the Chicagos were still leading the
League by one game when they packed their bats
and turned their backs upon Manhattan.</p>

<p>McRae was white with rage, as he told Iredell
after the game what he thought of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“You ought to have your brain examined,” he
whipped out at him. “That is, if you have enough
brain to be seen without a microscope. To steal
third when there was a man already on the bag!
You ought to have a guard to see that the squirrels
don’t get you. What in the name of the Seven
Jumping Juggernauts did you do it for?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was a man there,” said
Iredell lamely.</p>

<p>McRae looked as though he were going to have
a fit.</p>

<p>“Didn’t know a man was there!” he sputtered.
“Didn’t know a man was there! Didn’t know a&mdash;
Look here, you fellows,” he shouted to the rest
of the Giants gathered round. “I want you to
understand there are no secrets on this team. You
tell Iredell after this whenever there’s a man on
third. Understand?”</p>

<p>He stalked away from the clubhouse in high
dudgeon to share his woes with the ever-faithful
Robbie.</p>

<p>It was a hard game to lose, but Joe, as he
summed up the results of the Western invasion
felt pretty good over the record. The Giants had
won eleven out of sixteen games from the strongest
teams in the League, and were now only one
game behind the leaders. They had climbed
steadily ever since he had become captain.</p>

<p>But though he was elated at the showing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the team his heart was heavily burdened by his
personal troubles. His mother was still in a precarious
condition. He tore open eagerly every
letter from home, only to have his hopes sink
again when he learned that she was no better.
Sometimes the strain seemed more than he could
bear.</p>

<p>Then there was Jim, dear old Jim, with the
cloud on his brow and look of suffering in his
eyes that made Joe’s heart ache whenever he
looked at him. From being the soul of good fellowship,
Jim had withdrawn within himself, a
prey to consuming anxiety. He seemed ten years
older than he had a year ago. And as a player, he
had slipped undeniably. He was no longer the
terror to opposing batsmen that he had been such
a short time before. Joe gritted his teeth, and
mentally scored Clara, who had brought his friend
to such a pass.</p>

<p>But, troubled as he was, Joe summoned up his
resolution and bent to his task. His work lay
clearly before him. He was captain of the Giants.
And the Giants must win the pennant!</p>

<small>OUT FOR REVENGE</small></h2>


<p>“Joe,” said McRae, on the eve of the Giants’
second trip West, “I want to have a serious talk
with you.”</p>

<p>“That sounds ominous, Mac,” replied Joe, with
a twinkle in his eye. “What have I been doing?”</p>

<p>“What I wish every member of the team had
been doing,” responded McRae. “Pitching like
a wizard, batting like a fiend, and playing the game
generally as it’s never been played before in my
long experience as a manager. No, it isn’t you,
Joe, that I have to growl about. You’re top-notch
in every department of the game, and as a captain
you’ve more than met my expectations.
You’ve brought the team up from the second division
to a point where any day they may step into
the lead.”</p>

<p>“Give credit to the boys,” said Joe, modestly.
“They’re certainly playing championship ball.
That is, with one exception,” he added hesitatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“With one exception,” repeated McRae. “Exactly!
And it’s just about that exception I want
to talk to you. Of course, we’re both thinking of
the same man&mdash;Iredell.”</p>

<p>Joe nodded assent.</p>

<p>“I’ve worked myself half sick trying to brace
him up,” he said. “But he’s taken a bitter dislike
to me since he was displaced as captain of the
team. He only responds in monosyllables, or oftener
yet with a grunt. He’s such a crack player
when he wants to be that I’ve been hoping he’d
wake up and change his tactics.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” said McRae. “He’s been with
the team for a long time, and for that reason
I’ve been more patient with him than I otherwise
would. But there comes a time when patience
ceases to be a virtue, and I have a hunch that
that time is now.”</p>

<p>“You may be right,” assented Joe. “I’m sorry
for Iredell.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” replied McRae. “I’m sorry to see
any man throw himself away. And that’s just
what Iredell is doing. If it were only a slump
in his playing, such as any player has at times,
it would be different. But it’s more than that. I’ve
had detectives keeping track of him for the last
week or two, and they report that he has been
drinking and frequenting low resorts. You know
as well as I do, that no man can do that and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
play the game. So I’m going to bench him for
a while and see if that doesn’t bring him to his
senses. If it does, well and good. If it doesn’t,
I’ll trade him at the end of the season.”</p>

<p>“That’ll mean Renton in his place,” said Joe,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Do you think he measures up to the position?”
inquired McRae.</p>

<p>“I’m inclined to think he will,” affirmed Joe.
“Of course, he isn’t the player that Iredell is
when he’s going right. But he’ll certainly play
the position as well as Iredell has since we returned
from the last trip. He is an upstanding,
ambitious young chap, and he’ll play his head
off to make good. He has all the earmarks of
a coming star. With Larry on one side of him
and Jackwell on the other, and with you and
me to drill the fine points of the game into him,
I think he’ll fill the bill.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s a go,” declared McRae. “I’ll have
a talk with Iredell to-night. You tell Renton
that he’s to play short to-morrow, and that it’s
up to him to prove that he’s the right man for
the job.”</p>

<p>Joe did so, and the young fellow was delighted
to learn that his chance had come.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, Mr. Matson,” he promised,
“and give you and the team all I’ve got. If
I fall down, it won’t be for the lack of trying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Pittsburgh was the first stop on the Giants’
schedule, and Forbes Field was crowded to repletion
when the teams came out on the field. The
local fans had been worked up to a high pitch
of enthusiasm by the closeness of the race, and
they looked to see their favorites put the Giants
to rout, as they had on the first visit of the
latter to the Smoky City.</p>

<p>“Look who’s here,” said Jim to Joe, as the
two friends drew near to the grandstand before
the preliminary practice.</p>

<p>“Meaning whom?” asked Joe, as his eyes swept
the stands without recognizing any one he knew.</p>

<p>“In the second row near that post on the right
of the middle section,” indicated Jim.</p>

<p>Joe glanced toward that part of the stand,
and gave a violent start of surprise, not unmixed
with a deeper emotion.</p>

<p>“That lob-eared scoundrel, Lemblow!” he ejaculated.
“And confabbing with Hupft and McCarney.”</p>

<p>“Evidently as thick as thieves,” commented
Jim. “A precious trio. I wonder they have the
face to show themselves at a baseball game when
they’ve done the best they could to bring the
sport into disgrace.”</p>

<p>“Three of the worst enemies we have in the
world,” murmured Joe, as his mind ran over the
exciting events of the previous season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Hupft and McCarney had been members of
the Giant team that year. They were good players,
but had entered into a conspiracy with a
gang of gamblers&mdash;who had bet heavily against
the Giants&mdash;to lose the pennant. Lemblow was a
minor-league pitcher who had long wanted to
get a chance to play with the Giants. If Joe,
their star pitcher, could be put out of the game,
Lemblow figured that his chance for a berth would
be better. He also, therefore, had fallen in with
the plans of the gambling ring, and had, seemingly,
stopped at nothing to bring Joe to grief.
How their plans miscarried, how Hupft and McCarney
had been put on the blacklist that debarred
them forever from playing in organized
baseball, how Lemblow had been exposed and
disgraced, are familiar to those who have read
the preceding volume of this series.</p>

<p>“Wonder what they’re doing here,” puzzled
Joe.</p>

<p>“Rogues naturally drift together,” said Jim.
“I heard some time ago that the bunch was playing
with one of the semi-pro teams in the Pittsburgh
district. But they usually play only on Saturdays
and Sundays, so I suppose they’re choosing
this way to spend their off time. I suppose
if we could hear what they’re saying about us
at this moment, our ears would be blistered.”</p>

<p>“Whatever it is doesn’t matter,” laughed Joe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
“They made acquaintance with our fists once, and
I don’t think they’re anxious to repeat the experience.
But I guess we’d better pick out catchers
and begin to warm up. I’ve a hunch that the
Pirates are going to pitch Miles to-day, and if
they do we’ll need the best we have in stock to
turn them back.”</p>

<p>By the time the bell rang for the beginning
of the game, the stands were black with spectators.
The Giant supporters were comparatively few,
but they made up in vehemence what they lacked
in numbers.</p>

<p>From the beginning it was evident that the
game would be a pitchers’ duel. Miles was in
superb form, and up to the ninth inning had only
given three hits, and these so scattered that no
runs resulted.</p>

<p>But Joe was in the box for the Giants and was
pitching for a no-hit game. Up to the ninth, not
even the scratchiest kind of hit had been registered
from his delivery.</p>

<p>Could he keep it up? The crowd waited breathlessly
for the answer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>STEALING HOME</small></h2>


<p>With Burkett, Barrett and Joe at the bat for
the Giants in their half of the ninth inning, it
looked as though the nine might have a chance
to score.</p>

<p>But Miles had turned those same batters back
earlier in the game, and he nerved himself to
repeat.</p>

<p>“Murderer, are you?” he sneered, as the burly
Burkett came to the bat, and referring to a nickname
gained because of the many balls “killed.”
“Well, see me send you to the electric chair.”</p>

<p>“Aw, pitch with your arm instead of your
mouth,” retorted Burkett. “You’re due to blow
up anyway. You’re only a toy balloon, and I’m
going to stick a pin in you.”</p>

<p>But Miles had the last laugh, for he fanned
Burkett with three successive strikes, and the
latter went sheepishly back to the bench.</p>

<p>“That pin must have lost its point,” Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
called after him. “I knew you were bluffing all
the time.”</p>

<p>Larry came up to the plate, swinging three bats.
He threw away two of them and faced the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you throw that one away too?”
queried Miles. “You might as well, for all the
good it’s going to do you.”</p>

<p>“Your name is Miles, ain’t it?” asked Larry.
“Well, that’s the way I’m going to hit the ball&mdash;miles.”</p>

<p>He lunged savagely at the first ball that came
over the plate and lashed it into the crowded
grandstand for what would have been a sure
homer, if it had not been a few inches on the
wrong side of the foul line.</p>

<p>Larry kicked at the decision, but to no avail,
and he came back disappointedly to the plate. But
the mighty clout had sobered Miles somewhat,
and the next two were out of Larry’s reach and
went as balls. Larry fouled off the next for strike
two, and let the next go by for the third ball.</p>

<p>“Good eye, Larry,” called Joe approvingly.
“He’s in the hole now and will have to put the
next one over. Soak it on the seam.”</p>

<p>Larry caught the next one fairly, and it started
on a journey between right and center. Platz,
the Pirate rightfielder, took one look at it and
turned and ran in the direction the ball was going.
At the back of the park was a low fence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
separated the field from the bleachers. Just as
the ball was passing over this, Platz reached out
his hand and grabbed it. The force of the ball
and the rate at which he was running carried him
head over heels to the other side, but when he
rose, the ball was in his hand.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent catch, and well deserved
the thunderous applause that rose from the stand,
applause in which even the Giant supporters
joined, though it seemed to sound the death knell
of their hopes.</p>

<p>“Hard luck, old man, to be robbed that way,”
said Joe consolingly, as Larry came back, sore
and muttering to himself.</p>

<p>“To crack out two homers in one turn at bat
and not even get a hit,” mourned Larry. “Sure,
if I was starvin’ and it started to rain soup, I’d
be out in it with only a fork to catch it with.”</p>

<p>Joe received a generous hand as he came to
the bat, due not only to his general popularity but
to the wonderful game he had so far pitched.</p>

<p>“Oh, you home-run king!” shouted an enthusiastic
fan. “Show them that you deserve the name.
Win your own game.”</p>

<p>“Watch Miles pass him,” yelled another.</p>

<p>Whether Miles was deliberately trying to pass
him, Joe could not tell. In any event, the first
two balls pitched were wide of the plate, and the
crowd began to jeer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The third was by no means a good one, but
still it was within reach, and Joe reached out and
hit it between third and short to leftfield. With
sharp fielding it would have gone for only a clean
single, but the leftfielder fumbled it for a moment,
and Joe, noting this, kept right on to second,
which he reached a fraction of a second
before the ball.</p>

<p>That extra base was worth a great deal at that
stage, for now a single would probably bring
Joe in for the first and perhaps the winning
run of the game.</p>

<p>But would that single materialize? There
were already two men out, and the chances were
always against the batter.</p>

<p>Joe noticed that Miles was getting nervous.
Wheeler was at the bat, and Miles was so anxious
to strike him out that he was more deliberate
than usual in winding up. Joe took a long lead
off the bag, and watched the pitcher with the eye
of a hawk.</p>

<p>The first ball whizzed over the plate for a
strike. Joe noted that Wheeler hit full six inches
under the ball. Evidently his batting eye was
off. There was little to be hoped for from that
quarter.</p>

<p>When Miles started his long wind-up, Joe
darted like a flash for third. The startled catcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
dropped the ball, and Joe came into the bag
standing up.</p>

<p>“Easy to steal on you fellows,” Joe joshed
Miles, as he danced around the bag.</p>

<p>“That’s as far as you’ll get,” snapped Miles.
“I’ve got this fellow’s number.”</p>

<p>And Joe was inclined to think he was right, for
when the next ball went over, Wheeler missed
it “by a mile.” One more strike, and the inning
would be over.</p>

<p>Jamieson, the Pirate catcher, threw the ball
back to Miles. Before it had fairly left his hand
Joe was legging it to the plate. There was a
yell from the spectators, and Miles, aghast at
Joe’s audacity, threw hurriedly to Jamieson.</p>

<p>Twenty feet from the plate, <a href="#image01">Joe</a> launched himself
into the air and <a href="#image01">slid into the rubber in a cloud
of dust</a>. The ball had come high to Jamieson, and
he had to leap for it. He came down with it
on Joe like a thunderbolt, and the two rolled
over and over.</p>

<p>“Safe!” cried the umpire.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>A TEST OF NERVE</small></h2>


<p>The play was so close and so much depended
on it that there was a rush of Pirate players to the
plate to dispute the decision. But the umpire refused
to change it, and curtly ordered them to
get back into the game.</p>

<p>Joe picked himself up, and, smiling happily,
walked into the Giants’ dugout, where he was
mauled about by his hilarious clubmates, while
McRae and Robbie beamed their delight.</p>

<p>“You timed that exactly, Joe,” cried Robbie,
“and you came down that base path like a streak.
It’s plays like that that stand the other fellows
on their heads. Look at Miles. He’s mad enough
to bite nails. You’ve got his goat for fair.”</p>

<p>“It looks like the winning run,” said McRae.
“And it’s lucky that you didn’t depend on Wheeler
to bring you in, for there goes the third strike.
Now it’s up to you to hold the Pirates down
in their last half.”</p>

<p>“And rub it in by making it a no-hit game,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
adjured Robbie, as Joe put on his glove and
went out to the box.</p>

<p>Joe needed no urging, for his blood was up
and his imagination was fired by the prospect
of doing what had not been done in either League
so far that season.</p>

<p>But the Pirates were making their last stand
in that inning, and he knew that he would have
his work cut out for him. Their coachers were
out on the diamond, trying to rattle him and
waving their arms to get the fans to join in the
chorus. From stands and bleachers rose a din
that was almost overpowering.</p>

<p>Joe sized up Murphy, the first man up, and
sent one over that fairly smoked. Murphy lashed
out savagely and hit only the empty air.</p>

<p>“Strike one!” cried the umpire.</p>

<p>Murphy gritted his teeth, got a good toe hold,
and prepared for the next. Joe drifted up a
slow one that fooled him utterly.</p>

<p>Then for the third, Joe resorted to his fadeaway,
and Murphy, baffled, went back to the
bench.</p>

<p>Jamieson, who succeeded him, gauged the ball
better and sent it on a line to the box. A roar
went up that died away suddenly when Joe thrust
out his gloved hand, knocked it down and sent
it down to first like a bullet, getting it there six
feet ahead of the runner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Miles, the last hope, came up, and Joe
wound up the game in a blaze of glory by letting
him down on three successive strikes.</p>

<p>The Giants had won 1 to 0 in the best-played
game of the year. The newspaper correspondents
exhausted their stock of adjectives in describing
it in the next day’s papers.</p>

<p>Only twenty-seven men had faced Joe in that
game. Not a man had reached first. Not a pass
had been issued. Not a hit had been made. It
was one of the rarest things in baseball&mdash;a perfect
game.</p>

<p>And as the crowning feature, the one run that
gave the victory to the Giants had been scored
by Joe himself by those dazzling steals to third
and home.</p>

<p>It was a good omen for the success of the
Western trip, and the Giant players were jubilant.</p>

<p>“No jinx after us this time,” chuckled Larry.</p>

<p>“If there is, he got a black-eye to-day,” laughed
Jim. “Gee, Joe, that was a wonderful game. You
won it almost by your lonesome. The rest didn’t
have much to do.”</p>

<p>“They had plenty,” corrected Joe. “More than
one of those Pirate clouts would have gone for a
hit if it hadn’t been for the stone-wall defense
the boys put up. No man ever won a no-hit
game with bad playing behind him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>At the hotel table that night Joe noticed that
Iredell was not present.</p>

<p>“Wonder where Iredell is,” he remarked to
Jim, who was sitting beside him.</p>

<p>“Search me,” answered the latter. “He may
be in later. He’s so grouchy just now that he
seems to be keeping away from the rest of the
fellows as much as he can. You can’t get a
pleasant word out of him these days. I spoke to
him to-day on the bench, and he nearly snapped
my head off.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” remarked Joe, regretfully. “I’ve
gone out of my way to be friendly with him, but
he won’t have it. Seems to think that I’m to
blame for all his troubles.”</p>

<p>They would have been still more concerned
about the missing member of the team, could
they have seen him at that moment.</p>

<p>Iredell, on his way to the hotel, had drifted
into one of the low resorts which ostensibly sold
only soft drinks, but where it was easy enough
to get any kind of liquor in the back room. To
his surprise, he saw Hupft, McCarney and Lemblow
sitting at one of the tables.</p>

<p>There was a momentary hesitation on the part
of the trio before they ventured to speak to him,
for they did not feel sure how their advances
would be received. But a glance at his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
showed that he was in a dejected and reckless
mood, and that decided them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Iredell,” called out McCarney, with
an assumption of boisterous cordiality. “Sit down
here and take a load off your feet. Have something
with us at my expense.”</p>

<p>Three months before, Iredell would have
scorned the invitation. Now he accepted it.</p>

<p>They talked of indifferent matters, the others
studying Iredell intently.</p>

<p>“I noticed you weren’t playing to-day,” remarked
McCarney, with a sickly grin.</p>

<p>“No,” said Iredell, bitterly. “I ain’t good
enough for the Giants any more. They’ve benched
me and put that young brat, Renton, in my place.”</p>

<p>“Case of favoritism, I suppose,” said McCarney,
sympathetically. “Why, you can run rings
around Renton when it comes to playing short!”</p>

<p>“That fellow, Matson, has got it in for me,”
growled Iredell. “But I’ll get even with him
yet.”</p>

<p>“Sure, you will,” broke in Hupft. “Nobody
with the spirit of a man would take that thing
lying down. He’s jealous of you, that’s what
he is. You’ve been captain once, and he’s afraid
you may be again, and so he wants to freeze you
off the team.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>THE WARNING BUZZ</small></h2>


<p>“Matson has a swelled head,” declared McCarney.
“He thinks he’s the whole show. He’s
done us dirt, and now he’s thrown you down.
Are you going to stand for it?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not!” snarled Iredell, now in the
ugliest of moods. “I’ll get even with him if it’s
the last thing I do.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I like to hear a man talk,” said
Lemblow. “I owe him a lot for the way he’s
treated me, and so does every man here. We
all hate him like poison. Then why don’t we do
something? It ought to be easy enough for the
four of us to figure out some way to put the
kibosh on him.”</p>

<p>“It would be easy enough if he weren’t so
much in the limelight,” said Hupft, uneasily. “If
we put anything across on him, the whole country
would be ringing with it. The League itself
would spend any amount of money to run us
down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bigger men than he is have got theirs,” rejoined
McCarney. “It all depends on the way it’s
done. Now, a scheme has popped into my head
while we’ve been talking. I don’t know how good
it is, but I think it may work. If it goes through,
we’ll have our revenge. If it doesn’t we’ll be no
worse off and we can try something else. Now
listen to me.”</p>

<p>They put their heads together over the table,
while McCarney in a low voice unfolded his
scheme. That it was a black one was evident
from the involuntary start the others gave when
it was first broached. But as McCarney went on
to explain the impunity with which he figured it
could be carried out and the completeness of their
revenge if it succeeded, they gave their adhesion
to it. Iredell was the most reluctant of the four,
but his drink-inflamed brain was not proof against
the arguments of the others, and he finally acquiesced
and put up his share of the estimated
expense.</p>

<p>The next day witnessed another battle royal
between the Giants and the Pirates. Jim pitched,
and although his work was marked by some of
the raggedness that Joe knew only too well the
reason for, he held the Pittsburghs fairly well,
and the Giants batted out a victory by a score
of 7 to 3.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure of an even break, anyway, on the series,”
remarked Curry complacently, after the game.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Joe. “But that doesn’t get us
anywhere. That only shows that we’re as good
as the other fellows. We want to prove that
we’re better. To play for a draw is a confession
of weakness. I want the next two games
just as hard as I wanted the first two. That’s
the spirit that we’ve got to have, if we cop the
flag.”</p>

<p>But though Markwith twirled a good game the
next day and was well supported, the best he
could do was to carry the game into extra innings,
and the Pirates won in the eleventh.</p>

<p>“Beaten, but not disgraced,” was Joe’s laconic
comment, as he and Jim made their way to the
hotel. “Let’s hope we’ll have better luck to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had a box sent up to your room, Mr.
Matson,” said the hotel clerk, as he handed the
young captain his key. “It came in a little while
ago.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Joe, and went upstairs with
Jim to the room they occupied together.</p>

<p>In the corner was a wooden box, about two
feet long, a foot wide, and of about the same
depth. On the top was Joe’s name and the
address neatly printed, but nothing else, except
the tag of the express company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wonder what it is,” remarked Joe, with some
curiosity.</p>

<p>“It isn’t very heavy,” said Jim, as he lifted it
and set it down again. “Some flowers for you perhaps
from an unknown admirer,” he added, with
a grin.</p>

<p>“It’s nailed down pretty tightly,” said Joe.
“Got anything we can open it with?”</p>

<p>“Nothing here,” answered Jim, as he searched
about the room. “Guess we’ll have to phone down
to the office and have them send us up a chisel
to pry the cover off.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it will keep,” said Joe. “I’m as
hungry as a wolf, and I want to get my supper.
We’ll stop at the desk on our way back and get
something from the clerk.”</p>

<p>They had a hearty meal, over which they lingered
long, discussing the game of the afternoon.
Then they stopped at the desk, secured a chisel,
and returned with it to their room.</p>

<p>Jim switched on the electric light, while Joe
lifted the box and placed it on a table, preparatory
to opening it.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Jim exclaimed suddenly, turning
from the switch.</p>

<p>“What’s what?” queried Joe in his turn.</p>

<p>“That buzzing sound.”</p>

<p>“You must be dreaming,” scoffed Joe. “I didn’t
hear anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“It seemed to come from the box when you
lifted it up,” said Jim. “Lift it up again.”</p>

<p>Joe did so, and this time both of them heard
a faint buzzing, whirring sound that, without their
exactly knowing why, sent a little thrill through
them.</p>

<p>Again he lifted it with the same result.</p>

<p>The two young men looked at each other with
speculation in their eyes.</p>

<p>“Lay off it, Joe,” warned Jim, as a thought
struck him. “Perhaps it’s an infernal machine.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” laughed Joe, though the laugh
was a little forced. “Who’d send me anything
like that?”</p>

<p>“There are plenty who might,” affirmed Jim,
earnestly. “Remember those crooks we saw at the
game the other day! They hate you for exposing
them. I wouldn’t put anything past them. They’d
go to all lengths to injure you.”</p>

<p>Joe took out his flashlight and sent the intense
beam all over the sides of the box. Suddenly he
uttered an ejaculation, and pointed to a number
of small holes, not visible on a casual inspection.</p>

<p>“Look!” he cried. “Air holes! Jim, there’s
some living thing in that box!”</p>

<small>THE PACKAGE OF MYSTERY</small></h2>


<p>“A living thing!” exclaimed Jim, in wonderment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Joe, whose quick mind had already
reached a conclusion. “And I can make a
guess at what it is. It’s a rattlesnake!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Jim, aghast. “Oh, no, Joe, you
must be dreaming. No one would send you a thing
like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll bet that somebody has,” said Joe,
grimly. “That would explain the buzz we heard
just now. It was the whirr of the snake’s rattles.
We disturbed him when we lifted the box, and
he’s given us warning that he’s on the job. Lucky
we didn’t open the box while it was on the floor.
See here.”</p>

<p>He lifted the box and let it fall with a sharp
jolt on the table. This time there was no mistaking
the angry rattle that issued from the box.
They had heard it more than once when they
had occasionally come across one of the deadly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
reptiles while out hunting. It was one of the
sounds that once clearly heard could never be mistaken
for anything else. Even now, with the box
closed, it sent a thrill of horror through them.</p>

<p>Their faces were pale as they looked at each
other and realized what might have been the fate
of one or both of them but for that ominous
warning.</p>

<p>“You see the dope?” questioned Joe, with an
angry note in his voice. “I would be curious to see
what had been sent to me, and would open the box
probably with my face close above it. Then something
would strike me like a bolt of lightning,
and it would be good-night. I would have been
out of the game with neatness and dispatch.”</p>

<p>“The scoundrel!” ejaculated Jim, fiercely. “Oh,
if I only had my hands on whoever did it!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have a hand in settling that little
matter, too,” said Joe, with a blaze in his eyes
that boded ill for the miscreant if he should ever
be discovered. “But that can wait. The first thing
to do is to put this rattler beyond the power of
doing mischief.”</p>

<p>Jim’s eyes searched the room for some weapon.</p>

<p>“No,” said Joe, “there’s a safer way than that.
That ugly head must never be thrust alive out of
that box. Just turn on the water in the bathtub.”</p>

<p>They had a private bath adjoining their room,
and Jim turned on the tap. When the tub was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
half full, Joe brought in the box and put it in
the tub, placing sufficient weight upon it to keep
it beneath the surface of the water.</p>

<p>“Those air holes will do the business, I think,”
said Joe. “In a few minutes the box will be full
of water. We’ll leave it there a little while, and
then we’ll open the box and see if we guessed
right.”</p>

<p>At the expiration of twenty minutes, they
drained the water out of the tub. Then Joe got the
chisel, and with considerable effort forced open
the cover of the box.</p>

<p>“You see,” he said.</p>

<p>Jim saw and shuddered.</p>

<p>Lying in the water that was still seeping out
through the air holes was a rattlesnake all of four
feet long.</p>

<p>They viewed the creature with a feeling of
loathing. But still deeper was the feeling they
had against the scoundrels who had chosen that
cowardly way of attempting to injure Joe. The
snake, after all, was just the instrument. Infinitely
worse were the rascals who had employed it as
their weapon.</p>

<p>“We’ve had some pretty narrow escapes,” said
Joe. “And this is one of them. If you hadn’t
happened to hear that buzz, I might be a dead
man this minute.”</p>

<p>“It’s too horrible for words!” exclaimed Jim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
“It seems incredible that any one could plan such
a thing for their worst enemy. Who do you think
did it?”</p>

<p>“One guess is as good as another,” replied Joe.
“But if you ask me, I should say that the man
or men who did it sat in the grandstand on the
first day we played in this city.”</p>

<p>“Lemblow, Hupft and McCarney,” said Jim.
“One or perhaps all of them. Well, why not?
Lemblow tried deliberately to harm us both last
year when he pushed that pile of lumber over
from the scaffold above us. We came within an
ace of being killed. If he were ready to harm
us then, why shouldn’t he be again, especially as
he hates us worse now than he did before?”</p>

<p>“The box was certainly sent from somewhere
in this city,” said Joe, examining the cover carefully.
“There’s nothing to indicate that it came
by railroad. And there are plenty of rattlesnakes
in this part of Pennsylvania. Some of the stores
exhibit them as curiosities.”</p>

<p>“It’s up to us to put the police on the trail
right away,” suggested Jim.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about giving this thing publicity,”
mused Joe thoughtfully. “In the first place,
it would create a sensation. It would be featured
on the first page of every newspaper in the country.
And you can see in a minute how it might
react against baseball. The public would begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to figure that gamblers were trying to put the
Giants out of the race. They haven’t forgotten
the Black Sox scandal that came near to ruining
the game. We’ve got to think of the game
first of all. You remember what hard work we
had to save the League last year, and how we
had to forego punishing the scoundrels in order
to keep every inkling of the gamblers’ scheme
from the public. Baseball has to be above suspicion.”</p>

<p>“Then do you mean to say that whoever did
this is to get away scot free?” demanded Jim,
hotly.</p>

<p>“No,” said Joe, grimly, “I don’t mean that.
When the season closes, I’m going to make a quiet
investigation of my own. And if I find the villains
I’ll thrash them within an inch of their lives and
make them wish they had never been born. But
they won’t tell why I did it, and I certainly won’t.
At any cost, this thing must be kept from the
public. The good of the game comes before everything
else.”</p>

<small>DROPPING BACK</small></h2>


<p>“I suppose you are right, Joe,” assented Jim,
regretfully. “But it makes me boil not to be able
to put the scoundrels behind prison bars. Those
human snakes ought to have some punishment
meted out to them.”</p>

<p>“They surely ought,” agreed Baseball Joe.
“But we’ll have to postpone their punishment.
Everything will have to wait till the end of the
season. Apart from anything else, if we found
them out now and had them arrested, see how
it would break into our work. We’d have to leave
the team to come here to testify at the trial and
perhaps stay away for weeks, and that would
cost the Giants the pennant. But speaking of this
fellow here in the box, what are we going to do
with him? We can’t leave him here.”</p>

<p>“It’s rather awkward,” remarked Jim. “I suppose
we could take him down to the cellar and
have him burned in the furnace.”</p>

<p>“Not without arousing the curiosity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
furnace man and leading to talk,” objected Joe.
“I’ll tell you what we’ll do. We leave town
to-morrow night. We’ll wrap the snake up in a
compact package and carry it along in a suitcase.
Then at night while the train is speeding along,
we’ll open a window and drop him out.”</p>

<p>They agreed on this as the best solution.</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s no question that the snake is
dead,” remarked Jim, with an inflection of uncertainty
in his voice. “It would be mighty awkward
to have him come to life again in the suitcase.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’s drowned all right,” returned Joe.
“He was a long time under water. But just to
make assurance doubly sure, I’ll cut off his head.”</p>

<p>He took out his heavy jackknife and severed
the reptile’s head from his body. Handling the
grisly creature was a repugnant task, and they
were glad when it was finished.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll keep this head,” remarked Joe, as
a thought came to him. “I’ll slip it into a jar of
alcohol and that will preserve it indefinitely.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you want it for?” queried
Jim. “I shouldn’t think you’d care for that kind
of souvenir.”</p>

<p>“I have a hunch it may come in handy some
time,” answered Joe. “Now let’s wrap up this
body and get it out of our sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Their dreams that night were featured by wriggling,
writhing forms.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m not scheduled to pitch to-day,”
remarked Jim, at breakfast. “I’m afraid the
Pirates would bat me all over the lot. I never felt
less fit.”</p>

<p>“Such an experience isn’t exactly the best kind
of preparation for box work,” replied Joe, with
a ghost of a smile. “I guess Bradley will start,
while I’ll stand ready to relieve him if he gets
in a jam. I’m hoping, though, that he’ll pull
through all right.”</p>

<p>After lunch they took a taxicab to the grounds,
but the vehicle got in a traffic jam, and it was
later than they expected when they finally reached
Forbes Field.</p>

<p>They hurried over to the clubhouse and were
entering the door when they met Iredell, who was
coming out.</p>

<p>Iredell gave a sharp ejaculation and started
back, while his face went as white as chalk.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter, Iredell?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;nothing,” stammered Iredell, by a mighty
effort regaining control of himself and walking
away.</p>

<p>Their wondering glances followed him, and
they noticed that his gait was wavering.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose was the reason for
that?” asked Jim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’s been drinking again,” conjectured
Joe, regretfully. “His nerves seem to be
all unstrung. When he looked at me, you might
think that he saw a ghost.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did,” said Jim, slowly but significantly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Joe, quickly.</p>

<p>“Just what I say,” answered Jim. “Perhaps he
thought that you were&mdash;well, in the doctor’s
hands, and that what he saw must be a ghost.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” exclaimed Joe, in horror. “Lemblow,
Hupft, McCarney? Yes! But Iredell! A
man on our own team! A man we’ve played with
for years! No, Jim, I can’t believe it possible.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” admitted Jim. “I hate even to
think of it. I hope I’m wrong. But drink, you
know, will weaken a man’s moral fiber until he’s
capable of anything. Iredell’s been steadily going
to the dogs of late. Perhaps he’s fallen in
with McCarney’s gang. He knows all of them,
and a drinking man isn’t particular about his
company. Let a man hate you and then let him
drink, and you have a mighty bad combination.
Just suppose Iredell was in the plot. Suppose
he knew that rattler was sent to you yesterday.
Wouldn’t he act just as he did when he saw you
turn up safe and sound to-day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“It certainly was queer,” admitted Joe, half-convinced.
“I can only hope you’re wrong. At
any rate, it won’t hurt to keep our eyes on him
and be doubly on our guard.”</p>

<p>Bradley showed more form that afternoon than
he had before that season, and took the Pirates
into camp in first class fashion by a score of 5 to 3.
Apart from victory itself, it was gratifying to
McRae and Robbie to note that Bradley was
improving rapidly and furnishing a reinforcement
to Joe and Jim, who, in a pitching sense,
had been carrying the team on their backs.</p>

<p>Three out of four from so strong a team as
the Pittsburghs was a good beginning for the
swing around the Western circuit, and the Giants
were in high feather when they arrived in Cincinnati.</p>

<p>“Hate to do it, old boy,” declared the grinning
McRae, as he shook hands with Hughson,
“but we’ll have to take the whole four from you
this time.”</p>

<p>“Threatened men live long, Mac,” retorted
Hughson. “Just for being so sassy about it, I
don’t think we’ll give you one. Just remember
the walloping we gave you the last time you were
here. That wasn’t a circumstance compared to
what’s coming to you now.”</p>

<p>As it turned out, both were false prophets, for
each team took two games.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Five out of eight aren’t so bad for a team
away from home,” Jim remarked.</p>

<p>“Better than a black eye,” admitted Joe. “But
still not good enough. We want twelve games
out of the sixteen before we start back home.”</p>

<p>It was an ambitious goal, but the Giants reached
it, taking three out of four from the Chicagos
and making a clean sweep in St. Louis. It was
the best road record that the Giants had made
for a long time past, and it was a jubilant crowd
of athletes that swung on board the train for New
York.</p>

<p>“I’m already spending my World Series
money,” crowed Larry, the irrepressible, to his
comrades gathered about him in the smoker.</p>

<p>“Better go slow, Larry,” laughed Joe.
“There’s many a slip between the cup and the
lip. We haven’t got the pennant clinched yet, by
any means. And even if we win the pennant,
there’s the World Series, and that’s something
else again. It looks as though the Yankees would
repeat in the American, and you know what tough
customers they proved last time. And when Kid
Rose gets going with that old wagon-tongue of
his&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Kid Rose!” interrupted Larry, with infinite
scorn. “Who gives a hoot for Kid Rose? What’s
Kid Rose compared with Baseball Joe?”</p>

<p>Joe’s caution was justified by what followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
after the Giants’ return home. Suddenly, without
warning, came one of the mysterious slumps that
no baseball man can explain. If they had gone
up like a rocket, they came down like the stick.
They fielded raggedly, batted weakly, and fell
off in all departments of the game. Perhaps it
was the reaction after the strain of the Western
trip. Whatever the cause, the slump was there.</p>

<p>McRae raged, Joe pleaded. They shook up the
batting order, they benched some of the regulars
temporarily, and put the reserve men in their
places. Nothing seemed to avail. The “jinx”
was on the job. The Phillies and Boston trampled
them underfoot. In three weeks they had lost the
lead, and the Chicagos and Pittsburghs had
crowded in ahead of them.</p>

<p>Still Joe kept his nerve and struggled desperately
to turn the tide. He himself had never
pitched or batted better, and what occasional victories
were turned in were chiefly due to him. But
he was only one man&mdash;not nine&mdash;and the Giants
kept on steadily losing.</p>

<p>Only one ray of light illumined the darkness
for Baseball Joe. Mabel had come to him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>UNDER HEAVY STRAIN</small></h2>


<p>“I can’t believe you are real,” said Joe, contentedly,
lounging in a big chair and watching
Mabel as she flitted about the room, putting
small things in order and seeming by her very
presence to make the hotel room a home. “I
think you must be a dream or something. Come
sit down here and let me look at you.”</p>

<p>Mabel sat down beside him and looked at him
with dancing eyes.</p>

<p>“I might almost think you were glad to see
me, Joe dear,” she said. Then, as Joe moved
toward her, added quickly: “Do you know you
haven’t asked me a single thing about the home
folks yet?”</p>

<p>Joe’s face clouded and he rubbed a hand across
his forehead.</p>

<p>“Truth is, I’ve been afraid to,” he confessed.
“I have a hunch that neither mother nor Clara
has been frank in their letters to me. I’ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
worried sick!” he finished, in an unusual outburst
of feeling.</p>

<p>Mabel, studying the new lines about his mouth
and the strained look of his eyes, was inclined
to be worried herself, though not so much for
Mother Matson as for Joe. She said, as cheerfully
as she could:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry so dreadfully, Joe, if I were
you. Mother’s heart is stronger than it has been
for some time and she is wonderfully brave and
courageous.”</p>

<p>“She would be,” muttered Joe, adding in swift
anxiety: “In the last letter I had from her she
said she was in the hospital and the operation
was slated to take place in about a week’s time.
That would make it somewhere around day after
to-morrow. Good heavens! I can’t bear to think
of it!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t, any more than you can help,”
said Mabel, gently. “It won’t do Mother Matson
or the rest of us any good for you to get down
sick yourself, Joe. I wonder Dougherty doesn’t
order you off the team for a rest.”</p>

<p>“You wrote in one of your letters that you
had taken a flying trip to Riverside,” Joe reminded
her, and Mabel nodded.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to stay long. Mother Matson
was so sick and I was afraid she would think
she must exert herself to entertain me. So I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
just stayed overnight and caught the morning
train back to Goldsboro.”</p>

<p>“Did Mother give you any message for me?”
Joe’s voice was husky.</p>

<p>“Just her love&mdash;and this,” said Mabel, softly.
She held out her hand, and in the palm of it lay
a tiny, heart-shaped locket. Joe recognized it
as one that had long rested in his mother’s jewelry
case. He took it and opened it, and the
sweet face of his mother in her youth smiled back
at him.</p>

<p>Joe got up abruptly and went to the window,
standing for a long time looking out, with his
back to his wife. Mabel knew that he was
having a struggle with himself, and waited quietly
until he turned and came back to her.</p>

<p>“If I could get away from the team long enough
to go to her!” he said huskily. “But I can’t just
now. It’s impossible. I’ve got to keep after the
men every minute, or they’re apt to go to pieces.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t expect you just now, dear,” said
Mabel, soothingly. “She knows you can’t leave
the team. Now don’t worry.”</p>

<p>Joe sank down in the chair again, his head in
his hands. Finally he looked up and asked:</p>

<p>“How about Clara? Are things as bad there
as we thought they were?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so, Joe. It seems to me that Clara
is getting more and more entangled with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
millionaire all the time. He reads poetry to her,
too, in spite of the fact that he’s a great, strapping,
athletic looking chap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you saw him?” cried Joe, all interest
at once.</p>

<p>“Saw him!” repeated Mabel, with a short
laugh. “You might better ask me if I saw anything
else. He was around the place from morning
to night. I think if Mother Matson hadn’t
been in such poor health he would have come
around to breakfast, too.”</p>

<p>Joe got to his feet and strode around the room,
hands thrust deep in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Serious as all that!” Mabel heard him mutter
to himself. “How does Clara act? How does she
treat this&mdash;boob?” he demanded, suddenly stopping
short in front of Mabel and glaring at her
in exasperation. “Does she encourage him?”</p>

<p>“You might call it that,” Mabel returned, with
a puzzled frown. “She certainly accepts his attentions.
Lets him take her out in his beautiful car,
plays tennis with him, and listens while he reads
his foolish poems to her.”</p>

<p>Joe literally ground his teeth in futile rage and
exasperation. He began again his restless pacing
of the room.</p>

<p>“Did you have a chance to talk to her?” he
continued his cross-examination. “Did you ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
her what she meant by treating a fine fellow like
Jim so shabbily?”</p>

<p>“You forget, Joe dear, that I’m not Clara’s
guardian. It wasn’t my place to take her to task.
All I could do was try to sound her. She evaded
all my questions with some light answer, and
when I asked her point-blank whether she intended
to turn Jim down in favor of her millionaire&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What did she say?” interrupted Joe, swiftly.</p>

<p>“She merely remarked that I ought to know
better. She seemed to be offended, and if I had
pressed things just then the result might have
been a real quarrel. I thought the best thing
to do was drop the whole thing. After all, Clara
is old enough to know her own mind.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it!” said Joe, bitterly, adding in helpless
indignation as he again faced his wife: “Can
you imagine any reasonably intelligent girl turning
down good old Jim for a flossy millionaire?”</p>

<p>“Well, money sometimes dazzles a girl, especially
young and very pretty ones like Clara,”
returned Mabel, judicially. “I tell you what let’s
do, Joe. I know it would be lovely to have our
first dinner alone to-night, but don’t you think
we might include Jim? It might cheer him up.”</p>

<p>“It would be an act of charity,” agreed Joe.
“Jim is pretty low in his mind these days. I’m
sure he guesses there is something wrong.”</p>

<p>But in spite of their whole-souled attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
give Jim a good time that night, both Joe and
Mabel felt that they had failed. Jim tried to
rouse himself and meet their fun with some of
his own, but nothing could disguise the fact that
his heart was not in it.</p>

<p>He asked one or two listless questions about
Clara, almost, Mabel thought, as though from
a sense of duty, and after that maintained a dead
silence on the subject they both knew was uppermost
in his mind.</p>

<p>They had dined in a jolly restaurant full of
lights and music, but despite the hilarity all about
them, their party had been a dismal failure. They
were glad when the last course was over and
they could leave the place.</p>

<p>It was when they had reached the hotel and
Mabel had slipped into another room to remove
her hat and cloak that Joe turned to his chum
with a casual question.</p>

<p>“Got your letter from Clara all right this week,
did you?” he asked, in a tone that was not quite
natural.</p>

<p>Jim looked at him, surprised, then turned away
before he answered shortly:</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<small>BLUNDERING OLD REGGIE</small></h2>


<p>“Oh, Joe, I do believe I’ll go shopping to-day.”</p>

<p>Mabel turned from the window where she had
been standing looking down into the street. It was
a glorious day, bright and sunshiny, and her face
reflected the brightness of it.</p>

<p>“I do so like to shop in nice weather,” she
added, as she saw Joe’s indulgent smile. “And
if you like, I’ll stop and buy you some gorgeous
neckties.”</p>

<p>“Dear girl, is that a threat or a promise?”
teased Joe.</p>

<p>“Very well, I shall be completely selfish and
buy everything for myself,” Mabel promptly replied,
adding with a sigh: “How you do wreck
my generous impulses!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t mean to, honey, honestly,” said Joe,
contritely, adding with a courage that none appreciated
more than Mabel herself: “If you buy
me a necktie, I swear to wear it whatever happens!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel made a face at him and disappeared into
the other room, returning almost immediately
with her hat and coat on.</p>

<p>“I won’t have much time between practice and
the game,” Joe told her, as they went down together
in the elevator. “So have a good time,
girl. Take in a show if you like.”</p>

<p>Mabel promised to enjoy herself, and a few
moments later they parted in the sunny street,
going their separate ways. Mabel turned to wave
to him before she was swallowed up in the crowd,
and Joe thought with a full heart how lucky
he was.</p>

<p>“If I were in poor old Jim’s place now, how
would I feel?” he asked himself, and instinctively
thrust the unpleasant thought away from
him. He knew the agony of mind he would have
suffered if at any time he had been in danger of
losing Mabel, and pity for his chum took on a new
intensity. He was almost afraid to meet Jim
for fear of seeing that hopeless, lost look in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“He certainly knows&mdash;or guesses&mdash;something,”
he told himself. “If I get a chance to-day I’ll
sound him out on the subject. After all, it sometimes
helps a patient to have the wound lanced.”</p>

<p>After the Giants had dropped another game,
the chums, tired and disgruntled, turned their
steps toward the hotel again. Jim seemed more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
than ordinarily depressed and met Joe’s attempts
at conversation with discouraging monosyllables.
Several times Joe tried to lead up to the subject
of Clara, only to be rebuffed by Jim’s laconic
replies.</p>

<p>After that Joe relapsed into silence, studying
his chum thoughtfully. The thing was getting
serious. Jim’s silence and moroseness were growing
on him. And the worst of it was that he did
not seem to care. It was this very lethargy that
Joe found most alarming. He would have welcomed
an outburst of some sort, even condemnation
of Clara and her actions. It was Jim’s brooding
taciturnity that baffled him.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the hotel when Joe
felt a hand on his arm and turned to find himself
confronted by a dazzling person. He blinked,
and discovered that the vision was Reggie, dressed
as always, in the latest fashion from smart soft
hat to immaculate spats. Reggie swung his cane
and beamed. Perhaps because the friendly face
with its inevitable monocle was a welcome contrast
to Jim’s moodiness, Joe greeted his brother-in-law
with more than usual enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Say, but you’re a sight for sore eyes, old
chap!” he cried. “When did you blow in?”</p>

<p>“About an hour ago. Been busy all this time
lookin’ up a novel tie or two. Stopped in all the
shops hereabouts and, bah Jove, the best they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
could show me was a creation of salmon pink
with yellowish polka dots. No taste, no taste
whatever, one might say!”</p>

<p>“Poor old Reggie!” said Joe, piloting him toward
the hotel entrance and looking invitingly
at Jim. “I’ll put you wise to a couple of shops
where you can get all the novel neckties you
want. Come on upstairs, old boy, and see Mabel.
She’ll be pleasantly surprised. Coming, Jim?”</p>

<p>Jim hesitated for a moment, then nodded. The
three stepped into the elevator and were swiftly
shot up to the fourth floor. As they left the
elevator, Reggie looked Jim over critically and
gave vent to one of his too-frank observations.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ rather seedy, old chap,” he said.
“Off the feed bag and sleepin’ badly, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I’m feeling as fit as a fiddle,” retorted
Jim, brusquely.</p>

<p>The curt tone caused Reggie to look at the
other in mild surprise, and, seeing that he was
about to give voice to this emotion, Joe quickly
changed the subject, keeping the conversation on
safe ground until they reached the door of his
rooms.</p>

<p>Mabel had not yet returned from her shopping
expedition, and Joe felt curiously deserted as he
led the way into the quiet place.</p>

<p>“Mabel is out buying up the department
stores,” he said. “Reckon she will be back most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
any time now. Tell us about yourself, Reggie.
Every one well at home?”</p>

<p>Reggie glanced briefly at Jim, who had slumped
into a chair and was staring abstractedly out of
a window, then turned to Joe.</p>

<p>“Very well, old chap. In excellent health and
spirits,” he replied, puffing at a cigarette. “Missing
Mabel, of course. It is really quite remarkable
how that girl stirs things up. Bah Jove, it’s
a gift. Bally place gone dead without her, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can tell me anything about
that?” inquired Joe, with a humorously uplifted
eyebrow. “I know all there is to know about missing
Mabel!”</p>

<p>Jim turned from the window, rousing himself
with difficulty from his abstracted mood.</p>

<p>“I think she’s coming now,” he said. “Thought
I caught a glimpse of a red hat in the crowd.
Guess I’ll be going, Joe,” he added, listlessly.
“You three will have a lot to talk about.”</p>

<p>“Hang around, old boy,” urged Reggie, cordially,
placing the monocle in his eye the better
to stare at the disconsolate Jim. “Always regard
you as one of the family, don’t we? You
would be offending Mabel by running away just
as she arrives, you know. Stick around, old chap.
She will be here presently. Ah, here she is now.”
He rose quickly, the monocle falling to his immaculate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
waistcoat, the most genuine pleasure on
his thin face.</p>

<p>He took a step toward the door, but Joe was
before him. He caught his young wife&mdash;and several
bulky parcels&mdash;in a bear’s hug, and when she
emerged several seconds later, her face was
flushed and the little red hat was set distractingly
over one eye.</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe, and it was a new one, too!” she
wailed, evidently referring to the hat. “I had
such a gorgeous time. I bought and bought and
bought&mdash; Who is that in the corner? Reggie, you
old darling! Come here and give me a hug. Oh,
this is just the best surprise ever.”</p>

<p>“Rippin’. Had an idea you would like it all
along,” replied Reggie, complacently, as he favored
his sister with a brotherly embrace. “You
look perfectly stunning, you know. I say,” he
added thoughtfully, “did you see old Jim, hidin’
over here in his corner? I take it your neglect is
not intentional? No feud or the like, is there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reggie, don’t be so silly,” said Mabel,
flushing a little as she went over to Jim. “I just
didn’t see him at first, that’s all.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand and Jim squeezed it
heartily. There was a dumb suffering in his eyes
that tugged at her heart. If she could only tell
him something about Clara, something reassuring
and heartening!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Mabel was in the midst of a laughing recital
of her shopping tour when the telephone rang
and Joe, answering it, found that McRae was
in the hotel lobby waiting to speak to him. Reluctantly
Joe excused himself, while Mabel disappeared
into the other room to get ready for
dinner.</p>

<p>Reggie, left alone with Jim, turned his quizzical
gaze upon the latter. It was evident that Reggie
was very much puzzled by Jim’s strange behavior.
And when Reggie scented a mystery he
headed straight for the solution of it with a doggedness
worthy of a better cause.</p>

<p>“Hard luck the team’s been runnin’ in lately,
old chap?” he began.</p>

<p>“No hard luck about it. Bad playing. Bad
team work,” snapped Jim.</p>

<p>“Well, you shouldn’t worry, anyway, old chap,
you really shouldn’t,” reproved Reggie, mildly.
“Bad for the game you know, and bad for the
good old constitution.”</p>

<p>Jim looked at him, a slow anger in his eyes.</p>

<p>“If I never had anything worse than my constitution
to worry about, I’d be all right,” he said,
and turned his back upon Reggie, hoping that
such action would terminate the conversation. But
Reggie, in sublime ignorance, blundered on.</p>

<p>“I say, Jim, I’ve got it now. Worried because
Clara couldn’t come on with Mabel, eh? No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
doubt she wanted to come&mdash;rather. I say, old
chap,” he added, archly, lighting another gold-tipped
cigarette, “better tend to your knittin’.”</p>

<p>Jim, who had risen and was moodily pacing up
and down, stopped and looked at Reggie.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>The quiet of his tone disarmed Reggie, who
went on beaming pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Why, that millionaire who is hangin’ around
Clara, you know. Mabel has told you, hasn’t she?
Have I spilled the beans, Jim&mdash;let the jolly old
cat out of the bag, and all that? Frightfully
sorry. I thought you knew&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Reggie’s explanations and excuses wavered into
silence before the expression on Jim’s face. At
that moment he thought of nothing but escape,
and with a few muttered phrases about “huntin’
up Joe,” blundered from the room, leaving Jim
to his furious thoughts.</p>

<p>When, a few moments later, the door opened
to admit Joe, Jim turned upon him, all the pent-up
worry and nerve strain of the last few weeks
finding vent in a flood of words.</p>

<p>“I knew you and Mabel were holding something
back all the time, Joe. I’ve known from
Clara’s letters, for a long time, that something
was wrong. If you’re a friend of mine and have
any regard for me, tell me about this millionaire
who is hanging around Clara.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has Reggie&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, Reggie has!” retorted Jim, grimly. “Go
ahead, Joe, and tell me the truth.”</p>

<p>Seeing that there was nothing for it, Joe told
all he knew about Jim’s rival, glossing over the
details and making as light of the whole thing as
possible.</p>

<p>“So that’s that!” said Jim, quietly, when Joe’s
explanation had stumbled into silence. “The end
of everything!”</p>

<p>Joe, feeling deeply for his chum but powerless
to comfort him, said, with a forced cheerfulness,
“All this probably sounds a hundred times worse
than it really is, Jim. When you go down
there&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If she wants to marry for money, let her!”
interrupted Jim, with sudden ferocity. “Do you
suppose I’d deprive her of her pet millionaire?
Not much!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>GETTING A CONFESSION</small></h2>


<p>“It cuts me to the heart, Jim,” said Joe, with
deep feeling, laying his hand affectionately on his
chum’s arm. “I can’t tell you how sick I feel
about the whole thing. Nothing that affects you
can fail to affect me. You know that, don’t you,
Jim?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do, Joe. You’ve been a brother
to me ever since I joined the Giants. Whatever
success I’ve had in my work has been due to your
kindness, your teaching, your encouragement.
Don’t think I’ll ever forget it. I shouldn’t have
burst out the way I did, but you can’t know the
misery I’ve endured in the last few weeks. It
was bad enough when I only had a vague suspicion
that things weren’t right. Now it seems more
than I can stand. It’s hard, Joe, to see your
house of cards come tumbling to the ground.”</p>

<p>“I know it is, Jim,” replied Joe, with warm
sympathy. “But take it from me, Jim, your
house hasn’t fallen yet. I’m sure that Clara is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
true blue at heart, and that no matter how things
look, there must be some explanation that will
clear up everything.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Jim, though there was not
much hopefulness in his tone. “I’ve got to know
soon or I’ll go crazy. You see how this thing
has knocked me out of my stride. I’m not pitching
up to my usual form, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed it, of course,” said Joe. “And
I’ve guessed the reason. You’ve got all the old
stuff, all the strength and cunning, but you haven’t
been able to use it because of the burden on your
mind. Even at that, though, you’ve been turning
in more victories than the other fellows.”</p>

<p>“Which isn’t saying much, the way the team
is running now.”</p>

<p>“All the more reason for taking a big brace, old
boy!” exclaimed Joe, giving him a hearty slap
on the shoulder. “Try to throw off your troubles
and work your head off for the success of the
team.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” promised Jim, as he shook his
chum’s hand to bind the bargain.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Joe, heartily. “And promise me
one thing, Jim. Don’t hint at anything of this
in your letters to Clara. Nothing can really be
explained in a letter. Nothing in the world has
caused so much estrangement, so much heartache,
as trying to arrange a misunderstanding by letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
You can’t say just what you want, and what you
do say is never understood just in the way you
want it to be. Wait until you can see Clara face to
face, and I’ll bet the whole thing will be cleared
up in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“But that will be at the end of the season!”
exclaimed Jim, in dismay.</p>

<p>“Not so long as that, I guess,” said Joe. “I’m
going to see if I can’t by some means get Clara
to make a flying visit to New York.” He paused
a moment, and his brow clouded with anxiety.
Then he resumed: “Of course she can’t do it right
now because my mother is in too critical a condition.
But if the operation turns out all right and
she has a good recovery, it might be managed.
If not, I have something else in mind that I’ll talk
to you about later.”</p>

<p>To Joe’s already overburdened mind was added
another worry in the game with the Bostons the
next afternoon.</p>

<p>Jackwell and Bowen, while they had been affected
by the general slump of the team, had given
no evidence of a return of the peculiar nervousness
that had marked their actions earlier in the
season. But Joe noticed on that afternoon, the
frequent looks at the stand and the pulling of their
caps over their faces for which he had before
taken them to task.</p>

<p>Merton was pitching, and Joe was playing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
left. In the fourth inning, an easy fly came out
to Bowen and he made a miserable muff. Jackwell
also made a couple of errors at third. In
each case the blunders were costly, as they let in
runs.</p>

<p>“What made you drop that fly, Bowen?” Joe
asked, as the Giants came in from the field.</p>

<p>“I lost it in the sun,” replied Bowen. “At this
time in the year the sun comes over the grandstand
in such a way that it’s right in my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t heard you complain of it before,”
remarked Joe, dryly. “For the rest of this game
I’ll play center, and you shift over to left.”</p>

<p>The change was made accordingly. In the
eighth inning another fly came to Bowen and
again he dropped it while the crowd booed. The
error let in what proved to be the winning run
for the Bostons.</p>

<p>“I want to see you fellows after the game,”
said Joe, curtly, to the two men. “Wait around
the clubhouse after the others have gone.”</p>

<p>When the clubhouse was finally deserted by all
but the three, Joe turned to them sternly.</p>

<p>“I’m fed up with this mystery stuff,” he said.
“It’s got to end right here. It lost the game for
us this afternoon, but it isn’t going to lose another.
Come across now and make a clean breast of
it.”</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other uncertainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“You heard me,” said Joe. “Out with it now,
or I’ll see that you’re fired off the team.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Matson,” Jackwell spoke up
with sudden resolution. “I’ll tell you just what
the trouble is. Ben and I are afraid that detectives
are after us.”</p>

<p>“Detectives!” ejaculated Joe, with a start.
“What are they after you for? What have you
been doing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong,” declared Jackwell, earnestly,
and Bowen echoed him.</p>

<p>“Why should they be after you, then?” asked
Joe, with a faint tinge of skepticism in his tone.</p>

<p>“We got mixed up in a shady business,” explained
Jackwell, with a look of misery on his
face. “But we didn’t know there was anything
wrong about it till it went up with a bang. You
see, Mr. Matson, this is the way it came about.
Last winter, Ben and I were rather up against it&mdash;short
of ready money. You know what poor
salaries they pay in the league we came from.
We were down in Dallas, Texas, and the oil
boom was on. We saw an ad for men to sell oil
stocks, and we answered it. The fellow at the
head of it&mdash;Bromley was his name&mdash;was a smooth
sort of chap and could talk any one into anything.
From his description, we thought his oil well was
an honest-to-goodness well, and we sold a lot of
stock for him. Then came the blow-up, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
turned out that his well was just a dry hole in
the ground. He got out from under just before
the crash came, and I heard he went to Mexico.
The federal officers got after him and all connected
with it. We heard that warrants were
out for us, and we skipped North. But until
the company broke we thought they were straight
as a string. We wouldn’t have had anything to
do with it if we had thought it was crooked.
We were just roped into it. That’s as true as
that we’re sitting here this moment. All that
either of us got out of it was part of our salaries
and part of the commissions that were promised.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>IN THE DEPTHS</small></h2>


<p>The story had a ring of sincerity that was not
without its appeal to Joe. Still, he knew that some
of the most plausible stories are told by the worst
of crooks, and before accepting it fully he determined
to make some investigations on his own
account.</p>

<p>“Dallas is a long way from here,” he remarked,
as he eyed the two men keenly. “What makes
you think the federal agents are looking for
you?”</p>

<p>“Because we know some of the men that are in
the Dallas branch,” replied Jackwell, “and on
several occasions we’ve seen one or more of them
at the Polo Grounds and at other fields on the
circuit.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t say they’re looking for you,”
said Joe. “I suppose all of them take in a game
when they get a chance. Besides,” he went on,
as another thought struck him, “if they really
wanted you, it would be no trick to get you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Your names appear in the papers in the scores
of the game every day. Every one that follows
the game knows Jackwell and Bowen.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” admitted Jackwell, a little
shamefacedly. “But, as a matter of fact, we
didn’t go by our own names while in Dallas. You
see we thought the rest of the baseball players
would think that we were kind of hard up to be
working in the season when most of them are resting.
I can see now that it was a foolish sort of
feeling. But, as Ben said, actors and actresses
don’t go by their right names, and authors use
names that are not their own, and we had as much
right to do it as they had.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you had,” admitted Joe. “Though
in business I think it’s a mistake not to go under
your own name. What names did you go by?”</p>

<p>“Dan was Miller and I was Thompson,” put in
Bowen, who up to now had let Jackwell do most
of the talking. “So you see they don’t know
Jackwell and Bowen, but they might recognize
our faces, just the same. I suppose they have
descriptions of us, and that’s the reason we hate
to go on the field when we see they’re around.”</p>

<p>“And why you pull your caps down over your
faces when you do go out,” added Joe. “Well,
boys, I’m glad you’ve told me what’s been bothering
you. Perhaps the very telling will take some
of the load off your mind. For the present, I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
going to take your word for it that you didn’t
knowingly do any wrong. But I tell you frankly
that I’m going to have the matter looked up, and
if you haven’t told me the truth, you’ll have to
get off the team. McRae won’t have any one on
the Giants that isn’t as white as a hound’s tooth,
as far as character is concerned.</p>

<p>“But in the meantime, you’ve got to play ball.
We can’t let your personal troubles interfere with
the success of the Giants. There’s been many a
time when I’ve had a load of trouble on my mind,
but I’ve played ball just the same. The chances
are that you’re magnifying this thing, anyway.
You don’t really know that there are any warrants
out for you at all. You say you heard
there were, but the chances are that if there were
they’d have nabbed you before you heard anything
about the warrants. Those government fellows
don’t hire a brass band to let you know
they’re coming. Perhaps you’re tormenting yourselves
about something that never happened. And
even if it did, the agents have lots of bigger cases
to look after, and they may have forgotten that
you’re alive. But whether they have or not, the
thing that interests me just now as captain of the
Giants, is whether or not you fellows are going
to play the game. How about it?”</p>

<p>“I will, Mr. Matson,” said Jackwell, with decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
“I’m going to put this thing out of my
mind and play the game for all it’s worth.”</p>

<p>“Count me in on that,” declared Bowen, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” returned Joe. “Just remember
that the coward dies a thousand deaths
while the brave man dies only once. Half the
troubles that worry us in life are those that never
happen. Now forget everything but that you’re
ball-players, that as honest men you owe your
best services to the team, and that the Giants have
got to win the flag this year. That’s all for now.”</p>

<p>The results of this heart-to-heart talk were not
long in coming. Both Jackwell and Bowen seemed
to brace up wonderfully. The former took in
everything that came his way and made plays
that seemed almost impossible. Bowen ranged
the outer garden in first-class style and put
Wheeler and Curry on their mettle to keep up
with him.</p>

<p>The brace that they had taken was not long
in communicating itself to other members of the
team, and the Giants began to come out of their
slump. A stern chase is proverbially a long chase,
and it proved so in this case, for the Pirates and
the Chicagos had made hay while the sun shone,
and had piled up a commanding lead. But the
case, though hard, was not yet desperate, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the Giants had not relinquished hope of coming
out ultimately at the head of the heap.</p>

<p>As Joe had promised himself, he looked up the
Dallas matter. He had fully made up his mind
that if the men had been guilty of crookedness
they would have to get off the team. He would
miss their playing sorely, and would have all kinds
of trouble in plugging up the holes that would be
left by their departure, but anything was better
than a scandal that would damage the game. Of
course, the ultimate decision would be made by
McRae, but Joe knew his manager well enough
to feel sure that he would be in accord with him
in this matter.</p>

<p>Joe got in touch with a lawyer, who in turn
communicated confidentially with a Dallas law
firm, asking it to make inquiries in the oil-well
case and find out whether there had been any warrants
or indictments out for men named Miller
and Thompson, and if so, to find out the exact
charges on which the instruments were based.</p>

<p>A week or so elapsed before a reply was received.
Joe tore the letter open eagerly and
ran his eyes over the contents. Then he gave a
shout of exultation and brought his hand down
on his knee with a resounding slap.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Jim, looking up
in some surprise. “Any one left you a million
dollars?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not exactly that,” laughed Joe. “But I’ve
just learned something that makes me feel mighty
good, just the same.”</p>

<p>His elation was caused by these words in the
letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In re Miller and Thompson, we beg to
report that there were no warrants or indictments
handed down for these men in the
Bromley case. Investigation convinced officials
that they had no guilty knowledge of
the fraud. The only documents connected
with them were subpœnas calling them as
witnesses before the Grand Jury. Their
testimony was not needed, however, as a
true bill was found against Bromley, who is
an international swindler with many aliases.
He is believed to have fled to Mexico. A
reward of five thousand dollars is offered for
his capture.”</p></div>

<p>“Maybe this won’t be good news for Jackwell
and Bowen,” chuckled Joe, as he folded up the
letter.</p>

and won a hard fought battle. Atkins, the Philly
pitcher, was in capital form, and the game was a
seesaw affair, first one and then the other getting
the lead, and it was not until the ninth inning that
the contest was decided.</p>

<p>Farley, the third baseman of the Quaker team,
was a “rough house” player, who never hesitated
to transgress the rules of the game, provided that
he could get away with it.</p>

<p>One of his favorite tricks was to grab the belt
of an opposing player as he rounded third base.
This was often sufficient to throw the runner off
his stride and slow him up for a second, and in
a game where fractions of a second often marked
the difference between a run and an out, the momentary
delay many times permitted the ball to
get to the plate before the runner.</p>

<p>He resorted to the same trick also, when the
third base was occupied by an opponent and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
long fly was hit to the outfield. If the ball was
caught, the runner, of course, had to touch the
bag after the catch before he started for the
plate. Just as he started, Farley would grab
his belt. The umpire’s eyes would be on the ball
to see if it were caught, and Farley could do this
with impunity.</p>

<p>It was of little use complaining to the umpire,
for that functionary, not having seen the action,
could not well punish it. His eyes were his only
guide in making decisions.</p>

<p>Twice in this series with the Phillies the Giants
had lost in this way what would have been sure
runs.</p>

<p>On the day in question, Joe had made a two-bagger
and had got to third on a fielder’s choice.
There was but one man out, and the proper play
at this juncture was a long sacrifice fly to the outfield.</p>

<p>Wheeler got the signal and obeyed orders. He
sent out a towering fly that settled into the rightfielder’s
hands. The ball had gone high rather
than far, which gave the outfielder a good chance
to get it home in time to nail the runner.</p>

<p>If Joe was to make the plate, he had to get a
quick start and do some fast running. The fly
was caught, and Joe broke from the bag just as
Farley grabbed his belt. But not for a second did
Joe slacken speed. He flew along the base path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
at a rattling clip and beat the ball to the rubber
by an eyelash.</p>

<p>With the roar that went up from the crowd was
mingled boisterous laughter.</p>

<p>Farley was standing at third with a ludicrous
look of bewilderment on his face, holding in his
hand Joe’s belt. He did not seem to know what
to do with it, and shifted it from one hand to
another as though it were a hot potato.</p>

<p>Joe had unfastened it on the sly as he stood
at the bag, and when Farley grabbed it, it came
away in his hand without Joe even feeling it.
Farley had braced himself for the pull, and the
lack of resistance nearly threw him to the ground.
He had to stagger some steps before he could regain
his balance.</p>

<p>Peal after peal of uproarious laughter at Farley’s
foolish appearance rose from the spectators.
If ever there was a case of being “caught with
the goods,” Farley furnished it at that moment.</p>

<p>And the merriment swelled up anew when Joe
walked out to third, and with his hand on his
heart and a ceremonious bow, politely asked Mr.
Farley to return his property. With his face
flaming red from mortification, Farley threw it
to him with a scowl and a grunt, and Joe with
a tantalizing grin took his time in putting it on.</p>

<p>“Joe,” said McRae, as he shook his hand,
“when it comes to outguessing the other fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
there’s nobody in the game that can compare with
you. You spring things that nobody ever thought
of before. To-day’s an instance. More power
to you, my boy.”</p>

<p>Though the Giants had made an immense improvement
over their previous recent showing,
they were still far from the form they had showed
on their last Western trip. And a great part of
this, Joe had to admit to himself, was due to
Jim’s indifferent showing.</p>

<p>It was not that Jim did not try. He was intensely
loyal to the team, of which he had been
one of the principal supports. But the old spontaneity
was lacking. He had to force himself to
his work, where formerly it had been a joy to
him. And no man can do his best work under
those conditions. Twice within the last few
weeks he had been batted out of the box.</p>

<p>“Joe,” said McRae to his captain, “on the dead
level, what is the matter with Jim? He isn’t the
pitcher he was last season or in the early part
of this. What ails him?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, Mac,” replied Joe, who saw the
opening he desired. “Jim has heart trouble.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried McRae, in consternation. “Did
a doctor tell him so?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a case for a doctor,” explained Joe.
“The only one who can cure Jim’s trouble is a
certain girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it!” exclaimed McRae with relief.
“The girls! The girls! The mischief they
make!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget you were young once yourself,
Mac,” said Joe, with a grin. “Now I want to
ask you a favor. I have an idea that five minutes’
talk with that girl will set things all right. Why
not give Jim a few days off? I don’t ask this
simply because Jim is my friend. I think it will
be for the good of the team.”</p>

<p>“We’re pretty hard up for pitchers,” said McRae,
dubiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll double up while he’s gone,” promised Joe.
“I’ll pitch his game as well as my own. I’m as
fit as a fiddle.”</p>

<p>“You’re always that,” answered McRae.
“Well, have it your own way,” and he walked
away muttering again: “The girls! The girls!”</p>

<p>“Jim,” said Joe, later that afternoon, “how
about taking a train to-morrow afternoon for
Riverside?”</p>

<p>Jim jumped about a foot.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” replied Joe. “I’ve fixed it up
with Mac.”</p>

<p>“Glory hallelujah!” shouted Jim. “Joe, you’re
the best ever! Where’s that suitcase of mine?”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>TAKEN BY SURPRISE</small></h2>


<p>“At last I’ll know where I stand, anyway,”
muttered Jim to himself, as the train sped on
toward Riverside. “It wouldn’t have done a bit
of good to write to her. Her letters are so vague
and unsatisfactory these days. I must see her.
Then I’ll be able to tell whether there is anything
to this story of my millionaire rival.”</p>

<p>He tried to make himself think that there was
nothing in what Reggie had let slip, in what Joe
had reluctantly told him. Surely, they had been
mistaken. Clara, after all that had passed between
them, could not treat him so shabbily!</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;the thought made him frown and
bite his lip fiercely&mdash;where there was so much
smoke it seemed certain there must be some fire.
Long before he had known definitely of a rival
with millions who had been besieging Clara with
his attentions, he had thought he sensed a change
in her attitude toward him. Her letters had not
been so regular. Once or twice he had missed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
them altogether. Those that did come had left
him vaguely disappointed, unhappy. The reason
for his dissatisfaction had eluded him. Then suddenly,
it had all become clear. Clara was being
won away from him by a chap with more money
than he had! He clenched his hands and his
mouth became grim. At any rate he would have
one satisfaction. He would tell this fellow just
what he thought of him, and that in no uncertain
terms! Perhaps the chap would give him some
excuse for thrashing him. His eyes glinted and
his fists clenched.</p>

<p>The swift motion of the train was grateful to
him. It seemed to keep time with his hurried
thoughts. But the knowledge that every mile of
ground they covered brought him nearer to Clara
was more terrifying than anything else. He
thought of the last time he had boarded a train
to go to his sweetheart, and the lines about his
mouth grew deeper. He dreaded what he might
find at the end of the journey.</p>

<p>He had expected a letter from Clara that morning,
had hoped he would get it before leaving.
But, as had been the case more and more often
in the last few weeks, he had been disappointed,
had been forced to start on his trip with no word
from her.</p>

<p>He took out a magazine and tried to read.
The words were a meaningless blur before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
eyes, and he threw the magazine away from him
with an exclamation of disgust. What good was
he, anyway? He could not, even for a few moments,
force his mind away from his troubles.</p>

<p>And so it was with a mixture of perturbation
and relief that he at last came to an alert consciousness
of his surroundings, to find himself at
the next station to Riverside. He pulled himself
together and prepared to face facts. His uncertainty
was nearly at an end. It seemed to him
that nothing that could happen in the future could
be any worse than what he had already been
through.</p>

<p>Before the train had stopped at Riverside, Jim
had flung himself and his one bag on to the platform.
He glanced about him quickly to assure
himself that no old acquaintances were around the
place, then started off at a brisk pace in the direction
of the Matson home.</p>

<p>As he approached nearer his destination, he
unconsciously slackened his pace. He had sent
Clara no word of his coming. That part had
been intentional. Since he was about to find out
the truth, it would be far better to take the girl
by surprise than to warn her of his coming and
so give her time to prepare for it.</p>

<p>Perhaps, he thought bitterly, and his steps
lagged still more, Clara would not even care to
deceive him with a show of affection. This hated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
millionaire might even have dazzled her to the
extent of a broken engagement with him, Jim.</p>

<p>At the thought, new anger kindled in him, and
he strode forward with resolution. At the moment,
all he cared about was a meeting with his
rival. He did not know how soon that desire was
to be gratified.</p>

<p>A turn in the road brought him within view of
the pleasant Matson home. At the familiar sight
of it, something swelled in Jim’s throat. He had
felt so a part of that household, had been so wonderfully
sure of Clara’s love. Could it be possible
that all his faith had been misplaced, all
his hopes and dreams only idle and vain imaginings?</p>

<p>The house was coming nearer, seemed to be
rushing to meet him. With every step he dreaded
more to know the secret it was hiding from him.</p>

<p>He had reached the gate, had swung it open
noiselessly. The porch steps invited&mdash;the steps
where he and Clara had often sat in the twilight,
dreamily planning their life together. But for
some reason he avoided them.</p>

<p>He had no desire to see any one but Clara just
then, and instinct told him he would find her in
the garden. So to the garden he turned, hungrily
drinking in the fragrance of the flowers, the ache
at his heart more poignant as each new and familiar
object met his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>He heard voices and stopped still. One of them
was Clara’s. She was laughing lightly at some
pleasantry directed to her in a deep, masculine
voice.</p>

<p>At the sound, Jim suddenly saw red. All the
anxiety, the worry, the heartache of the last few
weeks, took toll at once. With a grumble of
wrath away down in his throat, he almost ran the
remaining few feet that hid from him the two in
the garden.</p>

<p>Clara was sitting on a rustic bench. She wore a
pretty dress of rosy material that matched the
color in her cheeks. She was looking up at a
blond giant whose attitude expressed complete
devotion. The giant was speaking in the deep,
musical voice which had so infuriated Jim.</p>

<p>“Miss Matson, I’m going to Europe in a few
days and I must know if I have any chance at all
with you. It isn’t possible for me to go on this
way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said Jim, in a voice of suppressed
emotion. “Sorry to intrude.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>A FRESH SPURT</small></h2>


<p>Joe had taken the first occasion to see Jackwell
and Bowen alone after he had received the letter
from Dallas.</p>

<p>“I’ve learned that there were papers out against
you in Dallas in connection with that oil swindle,”
he said, with an assumed expression of gloom.</p>

<p>“Then they were after us, just as we thought!”
exclaimed Jackwell, in alarm, while Bowen turned
pale.</p>

<p>“They were after you all right, but only as witnesses,”
laughed Joe, tossing them the letter.
“Read that.”</p>

<p>The expression of relief and happiness that
came to both, as they scanned the welcome lines,
was good to see.</p>

<p>“I’d rather have that than a million dollars!”
cried Jackwell, his face fairly beaming with delight.</p>

<p>“We can’t thank you enough for such good
news,” said Bowen, equally jubilant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Joe. “I had a hunch
right along that you fellows were on the square.
All the thanks I want now is to have you play
the game. You’ve been doing well lately, and I
want you to keep it up.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t a circumstance to what we’re going
to do,” promised Jackwell, and Bowen nodded assent.
“From this time on, just watch our smoke.”</p>

<p>And Joe had no reason to complain of their
work for the rest of the season. With the incubus
removed that had been lying on their spirits,
they played like wild men, and their work
soon enthroned them as favorites with the Giant
fans.</p>

<p>Now the Giants were really climbing again, and
the grounds began to be crowded as in the days of
old. The games were played “for blood” from
the ring of the gong.</p>

<p>And what put the capsheaf on Joe’s satisfaction
was that Jim came bursting in upon him one
morning like a whirlwind, his face radiant, and
sheer delight in living shining in his eyes.</p>

<p>Joe sprang up to greet him, and Jim grabbed
him and whirled him around the room until both
of them were gasping for breath.</p>

<p>“For the love of Pete, Jim!” expostulated Joe,
laughingly.</p>

<p>“I’m a curly wolf!” shouted Jim. “I eat catamounts
for breakfast and pick my teeth with pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
trees! Where are those Cubs and Pirates and
all the rest of that riffraff? Lead me to them!
I want ber-lud!”</p>

<p>“You’ll get your chance,” answered Joe, grinning.
“Now sit down and try to be sensible for
a minute.”</p>

<p>“Sensible!” scoffed Jim. “Who wants to be
sensible? I’m happy!”</p>

<p>“And so am I,” laughed Joe, “because of the
news you bring.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t told you any yet,” countered Jim.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have,” declared Joe. “You’ve told
me everything. I know that everything’s all right
between you and Clara.”</p>

<p>“Clara!” repeated Jim, dwelling on the name.
“Clara! Say, Joe, that sister of yours is&mdash;is&mdash;
Oh, well, what’s the use? There isn’t any word
in the English language to describe her. She’s&mdash;she’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” laughed Joe. “I’m her brother.
Now, old boy, take a minute to get your breath,
and then tell me the whole story.”</p>

<p>So Jim perforce had to restrain his ecstasies
and get down to earth, while Joe listened happily
to all the details of the visit that had swept away
the last shadow of misunderstanding between his
sister and his dearest friend.</p>

<p>“You were right, Joe, when you said that five
minutes’ talk, face to face, would wipe out all misunderstanding,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
said Jim. “Why, in less than
five minutes after I saw her I was the happiest
fellow on earth. If you could have seen the way
she flew to me!”</p>

<p>“What about that Pepperil?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Never was in it for a minute,” declared Jim,
happily. “Of course, the poor man was in love
with her; but you can’t blame him for that. Who
wouldn’t be? As a matter of fact, I think he was
trying to propose to her at the time I got there.
But she forgot he was alive when she saw me.
You see, she’d simply tolerated him for the sake
of your father’s invention that Pepperil had arranged
to finance. She couldn’t be rude to him
for fear of injuring the deal, though he bored her
to death. What with the nuisance of his hanging
around there and your father’s anxiety about
his invention and your mother’s sickness and the
cares of the household bearing down upon her,
the poor girl was nearly crazy. Told me that
when she sat down to write to me her head was
in such a whirl that she hardly knew what she was
writing. That’s why her letters sometimes
seemed so abstracted and unsatisfying. But now
the deal has gone through, your mother’s getting
steadily better, Pepperil’s sailing for Europe, and
we’re going to be married as soon as the baseball
season is over.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Joe, his eyes beaming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“And to think that I ever doubted her for a
minute!” Jim berated himself. “Joe, I’m the
meanest hound dog that ever lived. I’m not fit
for such a girl. Why, Joe, she’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” interrupted the grinning Joe.
“Write me a letter and describe her perfections
in that. But honestly, Jim, I’m as happy as you
are.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be!” declared Jim. “It isn’t possible
for any one to be as happy as I am.”</p>

<p>“Well, only a little less happy,” corrected Joe.
“And there’s some one else that will be just as
happy as I am. Mabel will be in the seventh
heaven. She’s worried herself sick.”</p>

<p>“Too bad.”</p>

<p>“Feel fit to pitch now?” asked Joe, after a
while.</p>

<p>“Fit?” cried Jim. “That’s no word for it.
Bring on your teams. They’ll all look alike to
me.”</p>

<p>And Jim proved in the games that followed
that this was no idle boast. He was superb, the
old invincible Jim, toying with his opponents and
turning in victory after victory. McRae rubbed
his eyes and Robbie chortled in glee.</p>

<p>“Sure, Mac, ’twas the best thing you ever did,
letting Jim off to see that girl of his,” said Robbie.
“’Tis a new man he is since he came back.”</p>

<p>The Giants were now like a team of runaway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
horses. They could not be stopped. With their
pitching staff going at top speed, the team played
behind them like men possessed. At home or on
the road made no difference. The Giants were
simply bent on having that pennant, and they
strode over everything in their way.</p>

<p>They kept their stride without faltering, and in
the last weeks of the season were rapidly closing
in on the Chicagos, who were struggling desperately
to maintain their lead.</p>

<p>On the last Western trip, their strongest opposition
was encountered in Pittsburgh, and they had
to exert themselves to the utmost.</p>

<p>The first game resulted in a Giant victory by
a close margin, the visiting team just managing to
nose through after a terrific struggle.</p>

<p>Just after the game had ended, Jackwell made
a sudden rush for the grandstand. Bowen, to
whom he had shouted, was close behind him.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim followed to see what it was all
about, and found a stout, red-faced man in the
grasp of the two athletes, while a policeman was
edging his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Arrest this man!” cried Jackwell, to the officer.
“He’s a swindler. His name is Bromley,
and he’s wanted in Texas. Detectives have been
searching all over the country for him.”</p>

<p>The man denied it, but Jackwell persisted. The
officer turned uncertainly to Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know the man,” said Joe. “But I know
that the federal agents are after a man named
Bromley. If this isn’t the man, he can easily
establish his identity at headquarters. These men
seem to be pretty sure of him.”</p>

<p>The officer put his hand on the man’s arm.</p>

<p>“Better come with me and see the Chief,” he
said, and the man, still protesting, was led away.
Later, federal agents identified him as the man
wanted, and Jackwell and Bowen split the five
thousand dollar reward between them.</p>

<p>“Glad those boys have settled their account with
that rascal,” remarked Joe, after the crowd had
dispersed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jim. “I wish we could say as
much.”</p>

<p>“You mean with the McCarney crowd?”</p>

<p>“Just that. My blood fairly boiled when I
saw those scoundrels in the stand this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Were they there?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Very much there! Heads close together and
talking all the time. Probably hatching up some
other plan to down you. I tell you, Joe, you’re
in danger every minute that you’re in this town!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>THE SNAKE’S HEAD</small></h2>


<p>“I suppose I am,” replied Joe, impressed by
the earnestness of Jim’s tone. “It’s up to us to
keep our eyes open. Luckily, we have only three
more days to stay here. All I want is to have
them keep away from me till the season’s ended.
Then the tables will be turned, and I’ll get after
them.”</p>

<p>Joe and Jim changed into their street clothes
and came out of the clubhouse. All the other
men had gone, except Iredell, who had not quite
finished dressing.</p>

<p>“Dandy weather,” remarked Joe, as they lingered
for a moment on the steps. “What do you
say, Jim, to a little auto ride to-morrow morning,
along the Lincoln pike? Splendid road and
fine scenery.”</p>

<p>“I’m on,” assented Jim. “I’d like nothing
better.”</p>

<p>The weather was perfect the next day, and
shortly after breakfast the chums hired a speedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
little car and set out for their ride. The machine
purred along smoothly, with Joe at the
wheel, and as travelers were comparatively few
at that early hour, they had the road largely to
themselves, and on the long stretches could let the
car out to an exhilarating speed.</p>

<p>“This is the life!” exclaimed Jim, jubilantly,
as he settled back in his seat and drew in long
breaths of the invigorating air. “It does a fellow
good sometimes to&mdash; Look out, Joe! Look
out!”</p>

<p>His shout of alarm was torn from him by a
great motor truck that came darting at high speed
from a side road that had been partially concealed
by trees and underbrush.</p>

<p>It came thundering down upon the little car as
though it were bent on annihilating it.</p>

<p>Joe’s quick glance took in the danger, and he
swerved sharply to one side. Not sharply
enough, however, to escape the impact altogether.
The truck caught the car a glancing blow that
hurled it like a catapult against a fence at the
side of the road, which at that point ran along
the edge of a deep ravine.</p>

<p>The car crashed through the fence, and had it
not been that one of the wheels struck the trunk of
a tree, would have plunged headlong into the
gulch. The blow slewed the machine around,
where it hung partly over the edge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim had been thrown against the windshield and
his hands were cut by the flying glass. Joe had
clung desperately to the wheel, and though badly
shaken up, had sustained no injury.</p>

<p>Without waiting to see the extent of the damage,
the truck had gone on at breakneck speed.
By the time the young men had leaped to the
ground, the truck had vanished around a turn in
the road.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim looked at each other, pale with
anger.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Jim?” asked Joe, as he saw the
blood on his comrade’s hands.</p>

<p>“Only scratches,” was the reply. “And I’m so
thankful I’m not dead that I don’t mind little
things like that.”</p>

<p>“It’s almost a miracle that we’re not lying at
this moment at the bottom of the ravine,” said
Joe, soberly. “What do you think of those fellows?
Did you ever see such reckless driving?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t reckless,” declared Jim, grimly. “It
was deliberate. That fellow was trying to run
us down.”</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>“Just that,” reiterated Jim. “Did you see the
man who was driving?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Joe. “I only saw the truck. I was
too busy trying to get the car out of the way to
notice the driver.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I saw him,” said Jim. “That is, I saw
part of him. He had his coat drawn up and his
cap pulled down so as to hide his face. But I
caught sight of the biggest pair of lob ears I ever
saw on any man. Does that mean anything to
you?”</p>

<p>“Lemblow!” exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>“Lemblow,” assented Jim. “And probably the
rest of the gang were in the truck back of him.
I tell you, Joe, those fellows are out to do you.
They failed in their first attempt, and so they
tried this.”</p>

<p>“And they came mighty near putting this
across,” said Joe. “But how on earth did they
know we were going on this ride? We didn’t
mention it to anybody.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Jim, “not directly. But when we
first spoke of it yesterday afternoon, we were on
the clubhouse steps. Iredell was still in there,
dressing, and the door was open.”</p>

<p>“By George, you’ve hit it!” cried Joe. “Jim,
the time has come for a showdown. We won’t
wait till the end of the season. We may not see
the end of the season if this kind of thing is allowed
to go on. I’m going to get even with those
scoundrels before we leave Pittsburgh.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you till the cows come home,” declared
Jim. “I’m aching to get my hands on
them. But how are you going to do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“By shadowing Iredell,” replied Joe. “It’s a
dead certainty that he’ll meet the rest of the gang
to talk things over before we leave the city. We’ll
keep him in sight every night from now on and
follow him to their meeting place. Then we’ll
trim the bunch.”</p>

<p>“Good dope!” ejaculated Jim. “And now let’s
get this car out to the side of the road where the
owners can send for it. There’ll be a good-sized
dent in our bankrolls by the time we get through
paying for the damage.”</p>

<p>They took care not to speak of the incident to
any one, and at the game that afternoon showed
no antipathy or suspicion in regard to Iredell.
Several times they noticed the covert glances of
that individual directed toward Jim’s scratched
hands&mdash;glances in which malignity was mingled
with disappointment&mdash;but they gave no sign, and
conducted themselves exactly as usual.</p>

<p>But not for a moment was Iredell out of their
sight without their knowing where he was. All
their faculties were intent upon using him as an
unwitting guide to the rendezvous of the gang.</p>

<p>For a time after supper, Iredell hung around
the lobby of the hotel. It was nearly ten o’clock
before he sauntered carelessly into the street,
where Joe and Jim were ensconced in the shadow
of convenient doorways.</p>

<p>Iredell walked along slowly at first, glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
about from side to side, but as he saw nothing to
arouse his suspicion, he quickened his steps and
soon was making rapidly for the outskirts of the
city. Joe and Jim followed at some distance,
keeping in the shadows as much as possible.</p>

<p>In a little while they found themselves in a
cheap quarter of the city, not far from the bank
of the Allegheny River. Factories and slag heaps
alternated with shabby dwellings, dimly lighted
stores, and low resorts.</p>

<p>Standing in a lot, with no houses for a considerable
distance on either side, was an old one-story
shack. From its battered and dilapidated appearance,
it seemed unfit for human habitation. But
that some one was in it was indicated by the light
from a smoky oil lamp that threw a flickering beam
through the open window.</p>

<p>Iredell pushed his way along the weed-grown
path and knocked three times. After a moment
the door was opened and Iredell entered.</p>

<p>Joe and Jim waited for a brief time, and then,
with the stealth of Indians, crept up near the open
window. Bushes were growing all around the
house, and behind these the two friends crouched.
The brushwood was so thick that they were perfectly
safe from detection, while at the same time
they had a clear vision of the room and its inmates.</p>

<p>They had no difficulty in identifying the latter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Hupft, McCarney, Lemblow and Iredell were
seated around a table, engaged in an excited conversation.</p>

<p>There was practically no other furniture in the
room than the table and chairs. It was evident
that none of the gang lived there, but that they
had picked out an abandoned house where they
could meet in security and talk with freedom.</p>

<p>There was no attempt to lower their voices,
and the unseen listeners had no difficulty in hearing
every word that was said.</p>

<p>“So we’ve made another flivver,” growled McCarney,
pounding the table angrily with his fist.</p>

<p>“Seems so,” said Iredell, moodily. “They
turned up at the game this afternoon just as
though nothing had happened. Barclay had some
scratches on his hand, but Matson was unhurt.
At least he didn’t show any signs of injury.”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to think we can’t down that fellow,”
muttered Hupft. “No matter what we do,
he comes up smiling.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” snarled Lemblow. “He’s had
luck, that’s all. The pitcher that goes to the
well too often is broken at last. There’s luck in
odd numbers, and the third time we’ll get him.”</p>

<p>Joe felt in his pocket and took out an object
that was roughly oblong in shape. He gripped
it tightly in his hand and waited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Jim, who had noted the action, reached out
and touched his friend’s arm.</p>

<p>“What’s the game?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“You’ll see in a minute,” returned Joe. “When
I start, you follow me.”</p>

<p>“Lemblow’s right,” cried McCarney, rising to
his feet, his face inflamed with passion. “We’ve
failed twice, but the third time we’ll get him.
We’ll get him so hard&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He never finished the sentence.</p>

<p>Something whizzed through the open window
with terrific force and caught him right between
the eyes. Taken by surprise, and partly stunned
by the force of the blow, he went down heavily
to the floor.</p>

<p>With startled shouts, the other three leaped to
their feet and stood staring at the table on which
the missile had fallen. Iredell leaned forward,
took one look and jumped back with a terrified
yell.</p>

<p>“It’s a rattlesnake’s head!” he screamed in
horror.</p>

<p>His shriek was echoed by the other rascals as
they fell back from the table, trembling as though
with palsy.</p>

<p>The next instant, Joe and Jim, who had jumped
through the window, were upon the rascals, dealing
out blows with the force of trip-hammers.
Iredell went down from a terrific right on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
chin, and lay motionless. Hupft and Lemblow
tried to fight back, but their nerves were so unstrung
and they had been so overwhelmed with
surprise at the sudden onslaught that their efforts
were pitiful. Joe and Jim, all their pent up indignation
putting double strength into their muscular
arms, gave them the beating of their lives,
until they cowered in a corner, covering their
faces with their hands and whimpering for mercy.</p>

<p>“I guess that will do, Jim,” said Joe at last.
“They’ll carry the marks of this for a long time,
and they’ll remember this night as long as they
live.</p>

<p>“Now listen to me, you rascals,” he said, with
withering scorn, as his eyes bored through the discomfited
conspirators. “What you’ve got to-night
isn’t a circumstance to what’s coming to you
if you ever dare to lift a finger against me again.
I could have every one of you arrested and put
behind bars for years to come if I wanted to, but
I prefer to settle my own quarrels. But just one
more move on your part, and you’ll go where the
dogs won’t bite you for a while.</p>

<p>“As for you, Iredell,” he continued, in a slightly
gentler tone, addressing his teammate who was
now sitting up on the floor, still half dazed, “I
could have you fired off the team in disgrace and
blacklisted forever, if I told McRae of this dirty
work of yours. But I remember that you have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
family and that you’ve played on the same team
with me for years, and I’m going to give you one
more chance. No one will hear of this if you go
straight from now on. Cut out these dogs of
companions and play the game like a man.</p>

<p>“Come along, Jim,” he concluded, “I guess our
night’s work is done. We’ll leave the snake’s
head behind as a souvenir.”</p>

<p>The night’s work was indeed done, and done so
effectively that Joe suffered no more trouble from
the precious trio. As for Iredell, the lesson had
been sufficient, and while there never was a resumption
of the cordial relations of previous years,
he gave no further cause for complaint. At the
end of the season he was traded, as young Renton
had filled his place so well that the Giants could
do without him.</p>

<p>The Giants “cleaned up” in Pittsburgh, and did
so well with the other teams that the last day of
the season found them tied with Chicago for the
lead. The Cubs had played out all their games.
The Giants still had one to play with Brooklyn.
If they won, they would have the pennant. If
they lost, the flag would go to Chicago.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>THE FINAL BATTLE</small></h2>


<p>The game was to be played on the Polo
Grounds, and excitement was at fever heat. It
seemed as though the whole male population of
Greater New York had determined to see that
game. Men waited in line all night, and from
early morning the surface cars and elevated trains
were packed with people going to the grounds.</p>

<p>The weather was fair, and the lovers of the
game had a day that was all that could be desired.
The turf had been rolled and groomed till it
looked like green velvet.</p>

<p>The odds were in the Giants’ favor, because
they were the stronger team and because they
were playing on their own grounds. Still, they
had been whipped by the same team before on
the same grounds, and they might be again. And
the nervous tension they were under because of
the importance of the game made them the more
liable to break at critical points in the contest.
The Brooklyns, on the other hand, had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to lose, and for that very reason might be the
cooler-headed.</p>

<p>McRae had picked Joe as his pitching “ace”
for this deciding contest. Grimm had been selected
as the boxman for the delegation from
across the bridge. At the moment, he was going
better than any other of the Dodgers’ staff, and
any team that whipped him would know at least
that it had been in a fight.</p>

<p>But on that day Joe feared no pitcher in the
League. He was in magnificent shape in mind
and body. In the preliminary practice with
Mylert he made the latter wince, as the balls
came over smoking hot.</p>

<p>“Save that stuff for the Brooklyns, Joe,”
Mylert protested, “or you’ll have me a cripple before
the bell rings.”</p>

<p>Not only Joe’s arm but his heart felt good that
day. Mabel was sitting in a box, watching him
proudly, and he felt that he simply couldn’t lose.
She was his mascot, and he carried near his heart
the little glove that had rested there when he won
the championship of the world.</p>

<p>Beside her sat Clara, flushed and happy and as
sweet as a rose. She had come on from Riverside,
bringing the glad news that Mrs. Matson
was making astonishing progress and had now
almost entirely regained her health.</p>

<p>So it was with a mind at peace and spirits high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
that Joe faced the doughty sluggers of the team
from across the big bridge.</p>

<p>From the very start, it was apparent that he
had “everything.” Never had he been in finer
form. Brain and muscle worked in perfect unison.
Every ball he pitched had a reason behind
it. He knew the weaknesses of every batter, and
played upon them. The man who was death on
low balls got a high one, and <i>vice versa</i>. His
speed, his change of pace, his curve, his fadeaway,
his hop, his control&mdash;all of these obeyed him as
though under the spell of a magician. If ever
a man made a ball “talk,” Joe did that day.</p>

<p>Again and again the Brooklyns switched their
tactics. Sometimes they lashed out at the first
ball pitched. Again they tried to wait him out.
These failing, they resorted to bunting. Nothing
was of any avail. They were simply up against
unhittable pitching.</p>

<p>Inning after inning went by without a score.
In the fourth, Naylor made a scratch, and in the
seventh, Leete hit the ball for a clean single. But
on these occasions, Joe tightened up, and no man
got as far as second, despite the desperate efforts
of their comrades to advance the runner.</p>

<p>Grimm, too, was pitching fine ball, but not by
any means airtight. The Giants had gotten to
him for six hits, but, with one exception, no two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
had been allowed in the same inning, and the
Giants were as scoreless as their opponents.</p>

<p>Grimm had thought discretion the better part
of valor when Joe had faced him, and had twice
passed him deliberately to first. The boos of the
spectators failed to disturb Grimm’s equanimity.
His motto was “safety first.” On a third occasion,
his cunning miscarried, and Joe, walking into
the ball in desperation, had clouted it for a two
baser. But as two were out at the time and the
next man fanned, he was left holding second.</p>

<p>In the ninth, Joe put on extra steam and fanned
three men in a row, amid the cheers of the Giant
rooters.</p>

<p>Then the Giants came in for their last half.
Grimm made Burkett hit a grounder to first that
was an easy out. Larry sent a Texas leaguer behind
second that was gathered in by the guardian
of that bag. Then Joe came to the bat.</p>

<p>Grimm still had no mind to give him a hit, and
the first two balls were wide of the plate. He
tried to put the third in the same place, but his
control faltered and the ball came within Joe’s
reach.</p>

<p>There was a mighty crash, and the ball started
on a line between right and center. At the crack
of the bat, Joe was off like a frightened jackrabbit.
He rounded first and started for second.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the right-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and centerfielders running for the ball, which
had struck the ground and was rolling toward
the wall. He knew that it would rebound, and
that one of the fielders would “play the angle,”
and thus get it the sooner.</p>

<p>The people in the stands had risen now, and
were shouting like madmen. He caught just one
glimpse of Mabel, standing in her box with her
hands pressed on her heart.</p>

<p>He made second and kept on for third. On
and on he went, as though on wings. His heart
beat like a trip hammer. His lungs seemed as
though they would burst. The wind whistled in
his ears. He had never run like that in his life.</p>

<p>He rounded third and made for home. The
ball was coming, as he knew from the shouts of
the spectators and the warning yells of his comrades.
Down that white stretch he tore. He saw
the catcher set himself for the coming ball, knew
from his eyes that the ball was near. With one
mighty leap, he threw himself to the ground in a
marvelous hook slide that swung his body out of
the catcher’s reach and yet just permitted his outstretched
fingers to touch the plate before the
catcher put the ball on him.</p>

<p>“Safe!” cried the umpire. The game was won,
the pennant cinched, and the Giants once more
were the champions of the National League.</p>

<p>What Mabel thought of Joe she told him privately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
What McRae and Robbie and his teammates
thought of him they told him publicly.
What the newspapers thought of him they told
the world. As pitcher, as batter, and as captain,
Baseball Joe was proclaimed the king of them all.</p>

<p>And what Mr. and Mrs. Matson, the former
happy because of the success of his invention, the
latter because of her restoration to health,
thought of their famous son they told to him a
few weeks later at a wedding ceremony in the
Riverside home, when Clara placed her hand in
Jim’s and made him the happiest of men.</p>

<p><i>Bomba lived far back in the jungles of
the Amazon with a half-demented naturalist
who told the lad nothing of his past.
The jungle boy was a lover of birds, and
hunted animals with a bow and arrow and
his trusty machete. He had only a primitive
education, and his daring adventures
will be followed with breathless interest
by thousands.</i></p>
